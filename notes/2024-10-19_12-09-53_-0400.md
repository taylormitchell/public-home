processing my todos, emails, interacting with calendar
the whole thing kinda stresses me out
I feel like there's lots to do and it's adding up. obligations.

it's really not that much. took me like 20min to get through things.
but I guess on a Saturday monrning, I just don't want to do that.
Would be nice to have an easier way. 
Like when I sat down I ended up getting accosted by work slack messages, random todos I didn't really need to do, emails, etc

I wish I could just ask my computer: is there anything *important* I need to do today? Give me a short list.
The human memory is kinda good at this when it works. Mines not so good at it though.
Computers/apps lean towards too much information. Too many inboxes, no differentiation b/w todos.
