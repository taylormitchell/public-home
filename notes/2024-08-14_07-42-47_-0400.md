Notes about the Shizen Young meditation quadrants 

Q: I don't understand why the standard shf is coded as "Appreciate". Same for the "Transcend" quadrant actually. 


Ontology expressed:

- There are 3 primarily channels of sensory experience: see, hear, and feel
- Each experience also seems to be inside or outside the body/head 
- There are 2 qualities of experience that spen the sensory channels: 
  - flow: the changingness of experience.
  - spaceousness: the "size" of experience. awareness can be contract around a small area or expand to a larger one.
- Experience has a valence (Q: Is this actually claimed? I'm taking this from the nurture column)

Excerpt from discussion with Claude on equinimity and thought

Hmm there's still something about it that feels off. When I really need to think through a problem, it feels like if I leave remove to both think and be aware that I'm thinking will use up some of my cognitive capacity. Like I work as an engineer, and sometimes you need to engross yourself in a problem you're working on, really think it through and think deeply about it. In those cases, you usually want to get into a state of "flow" where you're kind of unaware of time passing and yourself and you're just thinking. The state sounds like grasping based on what you've said so far. And from what I've heard from Shinzen, it sounds like grasping is a state we should avoid. Or put another way, he's said equanimity is "Training your sensory experience circuits not to interfere with themselves".  When it's said that way, it feels like pulling/pushing is like friction and isn't helpful in any sense and you should just try to reduce. But it seems to me that being pulled by a thought is a necessary mental motion you need to do to allow thoughts to propagate and make progress. How can I square this?
