## Morning Routine

## Work

- [x] misc PR reviews

### routing

- [x] fix routing - [x] single route option - [x] try pre-fetch way
      when I enable sync on route branch, everything fucks up
      something to do with the default nodes/relations not being loaded properly
      I don't think it's a problem with the new routing, but it's a bit surprising

### delete default nodes and relations

no stream node. no outline node.
only user node.
every graph needs a user node.
you don't need a relation between the user node and anything
