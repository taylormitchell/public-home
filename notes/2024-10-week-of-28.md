# Week of Oct 28 2024

Remember: [relax happy achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md)

I've got evening plans a few nights this week, then I'm away for the weekend, so I don't have as much time to get stuff done. I'm going to focus on personal errands and stuff instead of job search. I'll get the job search started in earnest next week.

Main todos
- DONE Book hotel block. Ask about price of hotel block
- DONE Changes to wedding website
- STARTED Secret video thing. Do this on tuesday
- Emily's birthday and christmas gifts

Ongoing habits:
- Continue experiment where mornings are free to do whatever I want
- Meditation at lunch and microhits during workday
- 10min of Anki during lunch too
- Keep logging water and other stuff

Maybe/fun:
- Auto-populate my intentions calendar based on notes in my journal
- list-positions, UUIDv8, https://x.com/jarredsumner/status/1850526527617966451?s=46
- ai with read/write access to my files, which reads changes and decided to action if needed
- Shortcut to open todays journal on iOS
- Give cursor prompt for my markdown autocompletes
- Re-organize files (see [this post](./2024-10-28_08-46-33_-0400.md))
- maybe mobx-linear, decorators, [list-positions](https://github.com/mweidner037/list-positions)
