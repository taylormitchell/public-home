While meditating, when you notice yourself lost in thought and had dropped the practice, you don’t need to fix it by clearing the mind (as I often to with a big breath). You can let the thought continue uninterrupted but just start the labelling practice again. The thought probably will fizzle out at this point but you don’t need to try to make this happen. It’s not good or bad. As long as your awareness is back (which you know if you’re labelling again) that’s all that matters
