Define a set of mutations: Each has a name and a set of arguments. Written in javascript.

Once you've done that, you just need to write handlers for those for each of the stores you have across your system. You don't have to be locked in to a certain state management library or db.

You can start with a simple "post to db + write to in-memory store" and then later transition to a sync system.
