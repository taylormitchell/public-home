it's kinda cool to think about each of my thoughts as a tiny atomic note, and that these could all be arranged in one big stream. everything afterwards could be built on top of that

If the user *has* to create their notes through our cli, that's limiting. Like in git, you can create, delete, edit files however you want. git doesn't need to be involved. then it can just do it's business after the fact.

That's what I'd want from my notes too. I can use some cli notes tool to create them, but I could also use text edit with a manual name placed into some folder.

What was the name of my thinking on this from before? notes-cli? something like that
