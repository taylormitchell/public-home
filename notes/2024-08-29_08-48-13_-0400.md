Feeling right now like I'd rather work at a company vs freelance or independent. In some sense, you have *more* independence at a company compared to freelance, in the sense that you don't need to think/worry about your job so much. You just show up and do it, no need to manage around it. This _should_ leave more space and energy outside of your work for other things (e.g. by worrying less, less thought-about-work drift, etc)
