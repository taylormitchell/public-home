Notes on [[Obsidian]] vs [[Cursor]] as my main application for my notes

*Obsidian*
Interlinking with square brackets is way easier.
Search-or-create on links and cmd+O is real nice.
I don't need to save? Seems like it's happening automatically.
Inline images
you can sort files by reverse alphabetical! 
no vim shortcuts to toggle heading open/closed :(
new shortcuts to learn
I already had extension I was thinking of building for vs-code just for myself. If I use Obsidian, there's a change those plugins would be used by others. 
I was hoping I'd be able to square-bracket link to my note cli file/readme or something but no dice cause the packages are in a different folder. Maybe they shouldn't be? Or maybe my vault should start at the root?
The quick-open sorts be recently opened. Has made jumping back to posts a lot easier
I like having cmd-backdash to open a terminal. I feel weird without it in obsidian
Having it in a separate app makes it easier to jump to
No shortcuts for collapsing means it's harder to control my field of view

*Cursor*
AI autocomplete on my notes is nice sometimes (other times it's not though)
I like having the terminal integrated into the app. Makes it really easy to run my note/todo commands. Also git syncing is more natural. 
I can search for files by heading
Supports non-markdown files e.g. I can't even see my `log.jsonl` file in obsidian (I dunno if I really need that though tbh. Or like, those files can be in the same repo, but I don't need to see them in obsidian. I can always open them in Cursor to edit them.)
vim mode is better. obsidian has plugin but it's not as good. 
I can put a symlink to my dropbox folder and then search all those too

*Outliner*
Much better imo at controlling the amount of information in field of view with zoom in/out
I've been leaning away from organizing files in folder space and instead organizing in hyperlink space. Does this make logseq more appealing? I think that was one of my main knocks against it.
