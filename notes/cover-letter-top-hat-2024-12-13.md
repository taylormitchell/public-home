Dear Top Hat Hiring Team,

The opportunity to shape educational experiences through data resonates with me personally - having leveraged online learning to transition into software development, I've experienced firsthand how transformative education can be. I'm applying for the Senior Technical Product Manager role to help make personalized learning experiences accessible to all students.

At Ideaflow, I led the development of a real-time document editing system that required careful orchestration of complex data workflows and synchronization. Working directly with our CEO and design team, I balanced technical feasibility with user needs while building our data architecture from the ground up. This experience aligns with Top Hat's need for someone who can collaborate across functions to deliver scalable data solutions.

At IBM Consulting, I designed and optimized large-scale data pipelines, achieving 10x performance improvements through careful analysis and architecture decisions. Working across multiple stakeholder groups - from engineering teams to business leadership - I developed a strong foundation in translating complex technical concepts into business value. I'm particularly excited about applying this background to Top Hat's generative AI initiatives, having seen how quickly emerging technologies can deliver tangible user impact.

I'm energized by Top Hat's mission to improve education through technology and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical product experience could help advance your data platform strategy.
