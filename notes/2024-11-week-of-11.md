# Week of Mon Nov 11 2024

Remember: [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md) and AGI is coming

## This week's intentions

- Apply to a couple less important jobs
- Ask Aiden to be my best man.
  - Set up Friday/Saturday hang.

- Email landlord about dishwasher and laundry machine
- Do some networking (see next-job-2024 notes, jacob's friend, tommy, etc)
- Figure out when to do something with groomsmen

- Book birthday dinner
- Finish video editing 
- Catch up on anki

## Ongoing intentions
- Continue experiment where mornings are free to do whatever I want
- Meditation at lunch and microhits during workday
- 10min of Anki during lunch too
- Keep logging water and other stuff

# maybe/later/fun
- Reinstate the “wrap up right away. Mac 30min wait”
- Add files to dropbox via cli
- Work on Linear project with AI assistance
- Maybe logger which outputs to file cause that’s a common pattern. Place into dropbox. Keeping those in git seems like too much. Maybe could have a symlink to it though
- update log app to use ai for input
- flashcard app
- Apply to a couple less important jobs
- Read about neuroscience of meditation
- meditation: life inventory
- ai with read/write access to my files, which reads changes and decided to action if needed
