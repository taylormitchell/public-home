# Meeting with Taylor and Lylia 2024-09-11

Lylia reached out to me on LinkedIn and set up this meeting to catch up and also pitch me on her new company.

She left IBM 6 months ago and went through the [Antler](https://www.antler.co/location/canada) program. It's like YC but even earlier stage and has a chapter in Toronto.

She didn't meet a cofounder or get funding but she did land on a product idea. They're building an AI chatbot to help with the sales process. You upload data about your past projects, pricing, timelines, etc. and the chatbot uses that as context to help you produce new content for your sales process.

They're aiming to get to 3 customers by the end of the year. They have one prospect that's close to signing a $50k contract for 3 months of service. She hopes to close that and have a prototype by November, at which point they can go raise money.

She's mostly focused on building the prototype but also on building the team.
