Write typescript api + frontend store for my app. 

Use flux pattern and either jotai or zustand for state. 

Data model defined with zod. Just todos for now. 

Use trpc. 

When an action is dispatched to the store, post it to the backend too. 

Don’t worry about handling rejected posts right now. 

At startup, store fetches all data from api. No need to pull periodically from store. 

There’ll only ever be one client active at a time. In the backend, write to SQLite file

maybe replicache for store?

can still define mutations using zod and use trpc.

it just handles all the syncing with the backend for me which is nice.

for undo/redo, maybe don't need to be fancy.

```ts
class Store {
    rep: Replicache;
    undoManager: UndoManager;

    constructor() {
        this.rep = new Replicache()
        this.undoManager = new UndoManager()
    }

    async createTodo({ id = uuid(), title = '', completed = false }: { id?: string, title?: string, completed?: boolean }) {
        const todo = { id, title, completed }
        const do = () => this.rep.mutate({ op: 'createTodo', todo })
        const undo =() => this.rep.mutate({ op: 'deleteTodo', todo })
        await do()
        this.undoManager.add({ do, undo })
        return todo
    }

    async deleteTodo(id: string) {
        const do = () => this.rep.mutate({ op: 'deleteTodo', id })
        const undo = () => this.rep.mutate({ op: 'createTodo', id })
        await do()
        this.undoManager.add({ do, undo })
    }

    async updateTodo(props: { id: string, title?: string, completed?: boolean }) {
        const currentTodo = this.rep.get({ id })
        const currentProps = props.reduce((acc, prop) => {
            acc[prop] = currentTodo[prop]
            return acc
        }, {})
        const do = () => this.rep.mutate({ op: 'updateTodo', id, props })
        const undo = () => this.rep.mutate({ op: 'updateTodo', id, props: currentProps })
        await do()
        this.undoManager.add({ do, undo })
    }

    async undo() {
        return this.undoManager.undo()
    }

    async redo() {
        return this.undoManager.redo()
    }
}

class UndoManager {
    undoStack: { do: () => Promise<void>, undo: () => Promise<void> }[] = []
    redoStack: { do: () => Promise<void>, undo: () => Promise<void> }[] = []

    add(action: { do: () => Promise<void>, undo: () => Promise<void> }) {
        this.undoStack.push(action)
        this.redoStack = []
    }

    undo() {
        const action = this.undoStack.pop()
        if (action) {
            this.redoStack.push(action)
            return action.undo()
        }
    }

    redo() {
        const action = this.redoStack.pop()
        if (action) {
            this.undoStack.push(action)
            return action.do()
        }
    }
}
```

Write typescript api + frontend store for my app. Use replicache for state management and sync. Data types defined with zod and shared between front and backend. Just todos for now. Define replicache compatible mutations this way too. Use trpc. Don’t worry about implementing the backend to handle the mutations and sync yet. Just define the routes using trpc posts. Have a store that wraps replicache and includes an undo manager. The store provides methods to create/update/delete which are undoable. Undo manager has two stacks: undo and redo, and each is an object with a do and undo method provided by the store.
