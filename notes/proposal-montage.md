[Montage of photos starts]

They say when you know, you know. But for me, it wasn't one moment â€“ it was thousands of them. It was laughing away in a secluded corner of a Prince Edward County winery. It was standing on a cloudy rooftop on New Year's Eve, surrounded by fireworks we couldn't see, finally telling you I loved you. It was the night in Tremblant watching you dramatically save the trip by dislodging a stuck car key. It was exploring BC, travelling through Italy, learning to surf and scuba together, and the way you made every new place feel like home just by being there.

But it was the smaller moments too. The ups and downs of fostering cats. Surprising me with signs and a cheering squad at my gymnastics competition. Carving pumpkins, cooking classes, and playing crib on the couch. From quiet mornings with coffee to winter cabin getaways.

We've run a half marathon together, crossed oceans together, built a life together. And with each passing day, I became more certain that every future adventure should be with you.

[As proposal footage begins] 

And so we found ourselves on another rooftop, this time with a clear view of the city lights, surrounded by flowers and candles. Looking at you, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. I got down on one knee and asked... Will you marry me?
