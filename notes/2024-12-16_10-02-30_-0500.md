If meditation trains you to rest awareness more on the here and now, that implies spending less brain cycles thinking about the future. That’s a trade off. Maybe you reduce suffering in the moment (people say this about being present) at the cost of planning for the future less. Planning is good! You can reduce future suffering by planning. Trade off can be worth it but it’s worth noting
