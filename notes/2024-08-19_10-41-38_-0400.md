I can have a stream which queries for objects that I don’t own. It cant be the case that every object needs to be added to every matching stream at write time. For one, clients won’t know about these streams, so can’t write to them. For two, the server could, but that would require checking the new object against *every single stream on the platform on every single create operation*. We can’t do that.
