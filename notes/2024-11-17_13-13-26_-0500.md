# Draft email to Uncle Drew and Uncle Dave re Grandma Sue's estate 2024-11-17

Dear Drew and Dave, 

Thank you for your thoughtful letter regarding Grandma Sue's estate distribution. I deeply appreciate the loving way you've managed everything, especially given the circumstances. It means a lot to see how carefully you're handling Grandma's wishes while she's unable to do so herself.

I've received my letter and cheque, and I know Bryce has as well. Courtney is currently checking with Canada Post about hers, but we've made her aware of the contents. 

Regarding the Iceland trip in May 2025 - what an exciting plan! All three of us are very interested in joining. We'll discuss the details among ourselves and get back to you soon with more concrete plans. It would be wonderful to have a family adventure together. 

Thank you again for everything.

Love, 

Taylor, Bryce, and Courtney
