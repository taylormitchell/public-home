4 quadrants
what's diff b/w appreciate and transcend? like what's the property that distinguishes them? Or what's going up/down as you move left/right?
It's not super cut/dry, but a couple things we discussed
- CCE is going up as you move right. 
- In both quadrants, we're seeing through the thingyness of our experience. There's some sense in which we're seeing through it even more as you move right. A new practitioner could probably notice that experience has an in/out property, but probably couldn't notice flow/spaciousness of it. So it's kinda like the degree to which we're seeing through the thingyness of experience. 
- In a previous categorization of techniques, there were only 3 categories and the top two quadrants were merged. This makes more sense to me personally. 

equinimity.
it's a state of non-pushing and non-pulling on experience.
but how can one think? seems to me like you need to allow thoughts to pull you, or to grab them in some sense, or else they just fizzle away. It feels like the motion of grabbing them which causes them to propagate.  
When equinimity is described as "training your mental circuits not to interfere", it makese it seems like equinimity should allow thoughts to propagate more freely. But if equinimity is also a non-grabbyiness, and grabbing is necessary for thinking, then how can equinimity and active thinking co-exist.
Short answer is there's a subtle distinction, or maybe a matter of degree. Too much gripping/grabbing gets in the way of thinking. Too little and it dissipates away. There's a state of *light* placing of attention on the thought which still allows it to propagate while being more equinimous than the default. The lightness can also make more space for the thought itself. Too much grabbing (or pushing away other experiences) uses up mental resources, leaving less for the thought itself.
