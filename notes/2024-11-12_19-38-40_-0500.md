Thinking about this prompt of mine
> AGI is coming. - Focus less on career, more on life. Re career: don’t need 5 year plan, or to fit what’s being done into an arc. Just improve at the craft of what you’re currently doing

Also thinking about the johnny ive quote about steve jobs' focus.

Maybe I should have more of that? It's easy for me to do at work but harder in my personal life.

I guess there's part of me in recent years that hasn't been wanting to "crack the whip" so hard on myself. I kinda want to be a person who does what they feel like doing. Someone who is driven by curiosity and interest.

Doesn't really feel like that's what my life is atm though. Feels more like I'm jumping b/w different things and not really making progress on any of them. Also it's not like I feel satisfied by the process of something. Like none of them go far enough to scratch the itch.
