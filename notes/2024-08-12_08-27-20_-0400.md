I haven't had a real project outside of work in a while.
I think this stopped when I re-committed to ideaflow. (feeling like that was a bad idea. I should've just left early this year)
It's fun to have a project on the go. Something to feel you're making progress on. Could just be something to fiddle with.
I guess what I'm doing with [these notes](./digital-home.md) is kinda that.
