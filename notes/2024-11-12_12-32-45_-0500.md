# Call about whether I need a gst/hst account
- gst/hst taxable if client is in canada
- if they're outside of canada, don't need to
- if I have an account though, I can claim gst/hst on expenses and get refunds
- if total income is above $30k and any of that is canadian, you need to have an account, even if the canadian part is below $30k
