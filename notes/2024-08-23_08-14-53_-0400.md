Feeling pretty unoptimistic about work right now. Like verge of quitting.
I'm gonna bring this up with Jacob during 1-1 today.
Even if I'm resolved to leave at end of year, I still gotta make things better between now and then.
I think I just gotta tell him that I need him to let me lead. Too often his compelled by a rabbit hole and I can't convince him not to do it. He'll say "wait wait it's actually easy and kinda elegant just give me a minute" and then a whole meeting has gone by and we've made little progress on the important stuff.
There's some part of me that thinks I should just relinquish control and let Jacob do his thing and I'm just hear being a supporting role making sense of him madness.
But most of me thinks it'll still grate on me. I can't spend my day in a place where inmate is running the asylum. I need his point of view, yes, but he needs to trust me to guide our discussions and needs to be better and letting go of his tangential thoughts and ideas. He needs to stop fighting me.
