Playing with obsidian plus my [[note cli]]. I'm feeling like this will end up being the solution.

Sometimes I hit something I don't like e.g. that the square-bracket linking only works on markdown files, and this makes me feel I should just roll my own system. But I think maybe it's better to accept constraints like that and design around them. Like default should be to use the tried and true lindy thing. Maybe I prefer to ui/ux of an outliner, but the benefits of the ecosystem and interoperability from standard file formats and apps far outweight the ui/ux improvements. Better to stick with the standards and improve on the margin.
