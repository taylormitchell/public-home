I kinda forgot about my work on the kindle extension last week.
cool that I got that over the line and published it.
still need some docs and stuff but it's good progress.

A weekly note structure:
- Intentions
- Summary
- Reflection

These were part of my intentions for last week:
- no twitter or audio for another week
- set foot in gym 3x/week
- Put heated eyepatch on 4x/day
- meditate and anki daily

I *really* fell of the wagon for the first and last. Did 2. Ok on 3.

Generally felt like I "needed" to take a break from these things.

want to feel like I'm making progress.
also want to keep [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md) mindset.

Sitting down and doing this feels useful. I don't like doing it under a time constraint though.
