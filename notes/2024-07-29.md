## mew meeting

### Agenda

- Clarify what’s necessary for the beta program
  - are there any features missing that block beta release? or just bug / stability issues?
- How far is mew from that?
- What are the next steps?

If we feel we’re close, we could just extend this iteration to finish. If we don’t feel close, then we should do a retro on the project before deciding what to do next

### meeting notes

Decided to mob on sync and feature bugs until end of day wednesday. Then on Thursday we can talk about releasing and next milestones for mew (maybe interim dev period to do public and stream)

### dev

Worked on relation to relation UI
