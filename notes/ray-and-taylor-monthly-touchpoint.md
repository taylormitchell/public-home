Tired after the trip to Italy and Spain. Did Rome, Florence, Venice, and Barcelona. He really liked Barcelona. The vibes. Also best looking women in the world. He got sick early in the trip thought and generally overbooked their time.
He probably won't be doing the marathon. After his last run he was walking funny for days.
He wants to get extrovert stoicism t-shirt
Aaron is getting married October 5th
He's still feeling good. He's not setting a million intentions and goals anymore. He's living day by day and enjoying life.

Dinner with Riley was good. Still just friends.
Rome for 2 weeks with his family 
Aaron is engaged to Merium
He's SUPER happy! He "realized" he's an extrovert, and what he cares about is meeting people, hanging out, being a good friend, etc. He's not gonna waste his time "getting good" at stuff for no reason anymore. So no more dancing, swimming, etc.
He's doing the Chicago marathon. Starting training now.

- trying to find the ONE thing. he thinks he knows now. he'll tell me in a year
- He asked out a girl, went to coffee, and turns out she's married
- He's getting dinner with [Riley](./Riley-(Ray).md) next Sunday (cute girl in early 20s who he kinda liked but she's too young and flaky). It's not a date! But should be a funny store
- He went to her yoga class and ended up getting lunch with her mom somehow
