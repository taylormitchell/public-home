Watched a video of Marc Andreessen talking about how Elon is so productive. He summed it up with "what have you gotten done this week?". But also just a relentless focus on getting down to the ground issue and fixing it. Feel myself pulled into that way of being. 
Is this in conflict with [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md) though?
