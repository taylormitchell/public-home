relation types entanglement
change log feed
when doing the layer load, get the nodes and relations such that the relation types should up right away on expand. 

pagination? if too long, make mew-edge data smaller (especially jacob's stream)


ship partial data loading
make mew-edge the staging instance. merging things there first. don't automerge to main
pill next to relation in dropdown. also for relation types

remove the "empty toggle" feature from the toggle dropdown


dedent arrow and hide until on hover/focus. def show when it has children. show on hover. show when non-expanded children.

default pinned collapse on quick capture

dropdown arrow for list & display pills (non essential)

should main view should always be in view. if you open the quick capture, move the main view to left if needed.

min width on quick capture.

put a button to collapse the side panel in top left corner. the X should be aligned with top of left panel content.

little comment button next to relation type dropdown which opens the relation in the sidebar.




## later

maybe consolidate jacob's datasets 
lose cursor sometimes even on cmd+k (probably happens after opening panel or quick capture)
