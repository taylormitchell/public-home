- why are you interested in joining ideaflow?
- what do you want in your next role? what would be some pros/cons of a role for you? 
- pros/cons of ideaflow from my perspective
	- still pre-PMF after a long time
	- team has churned multiple times
	- I still don't think we have a unifying story across the team. Some feel a bit lost wrt what we're up to and why. 
	- I think we're more aligned than we've ever been, and are making product progress that's aligned with Jacob's vision 
	- A bottleneck imo is great engineers and iteration speed. Momentum solves everything.
