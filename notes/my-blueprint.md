## Super Veggie

### Ingredients
- chicken breast, 150g (about 0.5-1 breast)
- Broccoli, 200g 
- Cauliflower, 150g
- Shiitake mushrooms, 50g
- Garlic, 1 clove
- Ginger root, 3g
- Lime, 1
- Cumin, 1 tbsp
- Apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp
- Pumpkin seeds, 1 tbsp (alternative to hemp seeds, similar nutrition)
- Extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp

### Instructions

Start with the chicken since it takes longest:
- Season the ground turkey/chicken with cumin, salt, and pepper
- Air fry at 380°F (193°C) for about 8-10 minutes, breaking it up halfway through

For the frozen vegetables:
- You can add them directly to the air fryer basket with the cooked meat
- Cook for an additional 8-10 minutes at 380°F, shaking the basket halfway through
- Pro tip: The frozen veggies will actually come out crispier than fresh ones due to less moisture

In the last 2 minutes:
- Add the mushrooms (if using fresh ones)
- Drizzle with a little olive oil and toss

All the other ingredients (garlic, ginger, lime juice, ACV, seeds) can be added fresh after cooking. The heat from the cooked ingredients will help release the flavors of the garlic and ginger if you mince them finely.

## Nutty Pudding

### Ingredients
- 100 mL milk
- 3 tbsp ground macadamia nuts
- 2 tsp ground walnuts
- 2 tbsp chia seeds
- 1 tsp ground flaxseed

- 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 cup mixed berries
- 3 fresh or frozen cherries
- 2 oz pomegranate juice

### Instructions
- Blend milk, nuts, seeds, protein powder, cocoa, and cinnamon until smooth (2-3 minutes)
- Add half the berries, cherries, and pomegranate juice - blend briefly
- Pour into a bowl
- Top with remaining berries
