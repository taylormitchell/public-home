Do morning stuff at the desk. This isn’t relaxing work. Its serious. Put on sweats and tshirt, not just a bath robe. 

Go back to getting the stuff I want to get done done in the morning. Seems to be the only way. Study Anki. Study 1 hr. Meditate 10min. Then job hunt 1hr. Workout 30min. Now it’s 10am. Start my work day.
