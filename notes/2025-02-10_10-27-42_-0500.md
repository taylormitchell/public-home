imo we should focus on the db layers + sync first. make sure we understand how data flows, the trade-offs around conflicts, etc. 

ui layer is easy. can get ai to do most of it.

you'll probably want some ui so you have to poke the db / sync system. but this should be suuuuuper simple. this isn't building the app. it is thrown away. it's just like a debug tool. no feature requests.



Description:
The app is a social note-taking / knowledge management platform with a pure graph data model. Users directly interact with and navigate through a graph structure, where each piece of information is a node that can be connected to others through user-defined relationships (edges).

Requirements:
- Instant start up. All of the following operations should be fast, but this is a rank-ordering of importance for speed:
    - time to capture
    - time to search
    - time to explore
- Fast user experience
- 100+ MB available locally (i.e. available offline and indefinitely)
- Social-network-scale data available online
- Real-time collaborative editing? What does this look like?
    - At the level of an individual node's content, is it ok if we're clobbering each other?
    - Is it just that the changes are seen instantly, but last-write-wins is fine?
- Graph queries? While offline too?
- Support for pulling in content from other apps


Open questions:
- Conflict resolution strategy
- Authentication, permissions, and privacy controls (to be addressed separately)
    - Users / teams / organizations ?


Initial thoughts:
- Electron desktop app
- SQLite for local storage

Sync 

Sync solutions:
- electric-sql
- firestore
- instantdb
- zero sync
- powersync
