Prototype 2 approaches:
- fluxy way (redux, replicache)
- mutatey way (linear, mobx)

In both cases, you generate transactions of operations that sync with a server. That part of the app can be the same in both. 

Then we can compare the approaches on top of it. Mostly in terms of dx. But can be perf as well.
