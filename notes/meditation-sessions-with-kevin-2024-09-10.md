Talked about one topic I have trouble defining. Here's a ramble:
- Auto-focus, auto-do, auth-speak, etc. Is this in conflict with "think before you speak"?
- Training meditation changes your mind. Does it change it in a way that actually increases well-being?
- If you start auto-speaking, maybe you say things you shouldn't have said (negative impact)
- If you're less driven by your ego and/or impulses: maybe those were guiding you usefully towards a life of well-being. If you become less attached to those things, maybe you become less able to be agentically effective in the world, and that's needed to act in such a way that creates more well-being for yourself and others.

^ I think this is worth reflecting on more.

Some potential names I could use for this topic / concept:
- "Mindful Spontaneity Paradox"
- "Meditation Efficacy Dilemma"
- "Conscious Automation Balance"
- "Impulse-Mindfulness Tension"
- "Meditative Agency Quandary"
