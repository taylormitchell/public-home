Events produced by mutations should be diff from what’s synced. See reversepatch. Collapsing these down to one type becomes weird

Also decorators won’t know collection names used in store so can’t use those in events. Maybe just use constructor as key? Like who’s to say the class name will match backend?

In linear, I think these classes know about the backend right? Like they define their own mutations to backend?
