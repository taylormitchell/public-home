- Diffs b/w us when diagnosing problems w/ perf. Feels like we're just blaming each other or something? You mentioned problem w/ serverless which I'd pushed for (and I don't get how that's a problem).

Bat at:
- Communication. Takes forever to figure out what you're trying to say. Also needs to happen in real time because 1) you won't do it otherwise and 2) you're written communication is bad.
- Too agreeable. You have strong opinions but are too timid to enforce them. We still end up making all the decisions you want to make but you kinda pretend you're seeding points while nudging us towards what you wanted bit by bit. Huge waste of time.
- Not very good at product generally. The judgements you make b/w doing now/later and easy/hard are often wrong.
- You aren't good at product discussions. You can't justify your positions well, and won't move in response to feedback. No one can help you do product b/c you won't take feedback. This could be fine if your product ideas were good but they're often not.

- You're too bad of a communicator and collaborator. I often need to execute on incoherent ideas cause I can't find a way for us to get on the same page (product/features, strategy, etc)

### 2024-09-27
- Diffs again on product taste. Didn't resonate with your resolutions to my "ref a list node without adding as item" report. Also didn't resonate with your ideas for collecting the ideas from our brainstorm.

- Other ways you're bottlenecking the company
  - Agu, Evan, and myself have all pointed out that the website doesn't reflect what we're up to right now. The jobs also don't reflect what we're looking for. No one can autonomously work on this though cause no one has confidence they can update it in a way that'll be aligned with what you want. This is a communication problem. If you could clearly communicate where we're headed and what we're up to, they'd have a much better chance of updating the website in a way that aligns with your/the company's goals.

### 2024-09-13
- Too many diffs on product taste. Most recent example "::" vs ":" and whether to have settings or good defaults.
- Making progress on product is *so hard* and *so slow*. It takes so much effort to keep us on track and handle threads you open. I was thinking we'd have figured out every in [Mew product design and strategy](https://linear.app/ideaflow/project/mew-product-design-and-strategy-0badc290c898) in 2 weeks and we're only 1/3 of the way through with no progress on a product plan. The thing we took the longest on, the stream, isn't even done! You updated your thinking on this yesterday again, and back to the conception we had start with. Going in circles like this is not uncommon for us, and it's really frustrating.

- Great job on PRs today

- I really appreciate how you push back when what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you. Often people will just nod along even if they have doubts (or worse, they're not even trying (or able) to understand so can't push back). I consistently see you trying to make sense of things yourself and pushing back when you don't think something is right. This is super valuable.
### 2024-09-10
- Easy to talk through PR today. It felt like you were a little resistant to my suggestion. I think we settled on a dirtier solution than we should have. (I have a feeling there was lots of blame to go my way. Maybe I wasn't forward enough. Too passive aggressive.)
