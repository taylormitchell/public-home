I feel an unresolved conflict in me between the [](./relax-happy-achieve.md) idea and "all in at ideaflow until November". I can't keep myself in the later state, and part of me resists it too, believing more strongly in the former. Another part of me just thinks I need to decide on a balance between the two and then stick to that. I still feel that even if I can get myself contributing balanced hours, there's a vibe conflict that still suffuses the experience causing progress on either to be less effective.
