I've been doing my morning/evening routine less frequently recently.
Mostly cause I've switched up my notetaking set up for personal and work and so it's less of a habit.
I also have a split b/w notes for work vs personal, with routines stored in personal notes not work.
I used to do my end of day routine as part of work, where I'd also plan out my next day for personal self (e.g. morning routine).

Right now I'm thinking about whether that split between personal and work makes sense.
Like previously I'd mix together work and personal during weekly and daily planning.
Logistically, this is easier, but it tends to mean I focus more on work and less on personal.
If I try to do both, the work thoughts crowd out the rest. 
Makes me think I _should_ do separate personal/work planning/reviewing routines like this.
