getting up this morning (and many mornings) feels like a fight / struggle
sometimes I get into a rythm where it's automatic and I just get up
but after a while of that, I feel kinda like an automaton with no agency
it's like, if I allow myself too much decision making in the morning, then there's suffering involved cause 1) getting up is a fight cause it's a decision I could choose against and 2) it can be overwhelming to decide what to do when it's completely open ended
but if I don't give myself any decision making, like the morning is completely defined in advance, then it can feel like there's a straight jacket around me. I'm stuck.
Is this just a constant struggle that people deal with? Or do some people figure out the balance and are pretty content with it?
