The natural ones looked like little crabs and had been quietly inhabiting the outer layers of other creatures' bodies for hundreds of millions of years. The artificial ones had all been developed in the past few decades. Most of them consisted of a spherical or ellipsoidal hull with various attachments. The hull was a vacuole, a wee bit of the eutactic environment to coddle the mite's machine-phase innards. The hull's diamondoid structure was protected from the light by a thin layer of aluminum that made mites look like miniature spaceships—only with the air on the outside and the vacuum inside.",

The results were surprising: over the course of as little as a few weeks, managers who threw monkey wrenches into their routines in this way found that they were also able to change the way they treated subordinates. The reason, says Fletcher, is that people tend to get trapped in what he calls “habit webs.” When they try to effect an important, useful change, they find they’re stuck tight. But if they snip away at individual, thin, supporting strands of the web, the web can eventually be loosened enough to permit more important change.",

Consider fan-out for classes: it is defined as the number of classes referenced either directly or indirectly from a class of interest. You can think of this as a count of all the classes that must be compiled before your class can be compiled. Fan-in, on the other hand, is a count of all classes that depend upon the class of interest. Knowing fan-out and fan-in, we can calculate an instability factor using I = fo / (fi + fo). As I approaches 0, the package becomes more stable. As I approaches 1, the package becomes unstable. Packages that are stable are low-risk targets for recoding, whereas unstable packages are more likely to be filled with dirty code bombs. The goal in refactoring is to move I closer to 0.",

      "highlight": "I come across many startups that are struggling to answer the following questions: Which customer opinions should we listen to, if any? How should we prioritize across the many features we could build? Which features are essential to the product’s success and which are ancillary? What can be changed safely, and what might anger customers? What might please today’s customers at the expense of tomorrow’s? What should we work on next? These are some of the questions teams struggle to answer if they have followed the “let’s just ship a product and see what happens” plan. I call this the “just do it” school of entrepreneurship after Nike’s famous slogan.1 Unfortunately, if the plan is to see what happens, a team is guaranteed to succeed—at seeing what happens—but won’t necessarily gain validated learning. This is one of the most important lessons of the scientific method: if you cannot fail, you cannot learn.",

Thus, stories could be cataloged as being in one of four states of development: in the product backlog, actively being built, done (feature complete from a technical point of view), or in the process of being validated. Validated was defined as “knowing whether the story was a good idea to have been done in the first place.” This validation usually would come in the form of a split test showing a change in customer behavior but also might include customer interviews or surveys.",

Second, reading, if it is active, is thinking, and thinking tends to express itself in words, spoken or written. The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks. Third, writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author.",

For instance, theories about geometry and optics tell us not to expect to see a sunrise on a cloudy day, even if a sunrise is really happening in the unobserved world behind the clouds. Only from those explanatory theories do we know that failing to see the sun on such days does not amount to an experience of its not rising. Similarly, theory tells us that if we see sunrise reflected in a mirror, or in a video or a virtual-reality game, that does not count as seeing it twice. Thus the very idea that an experience has been repeated is not itself a sensory experience, but a theory.",

They kind of make a conjecture about the behaviour of the system though don’t they? It’s whatever the function is that the model learned. Although these are rather constrained for some models. It also doesn’t seem to be the same way that humans conjecture the behaviour of nature. (Related: max tegmarks work on AI which tries to learn physics equations)",

Somewhat less trivially, it leads to the rejection of authority, because if we adopt a theory on authority, that means that we would also have accepted a range of different theories on authority. And hence it also implies the need for a tradition of criticism.

If some people lack the self-control to stay below the carrying capacity of their own private resource, those people will harm only themselves and not others. Regulate the commons. Garrett Hardin calls this option, bluntly, “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.” Regulation can take many forms, from outright bans on certain behaviors to quotas, permits, taxes, incentives.

Doing something requires energy, and most morally salient actions are associated with conscious intent. Failing to do something can arise purely by circumstance and requires energy to rectify. The difference is important. It is one thing to reach into the till and steal $100; it is another to neglect to return $100 that one has received by mistake. We might consider both behaviors to be ethically blameworthy—but only the former amounts to a deliberate effort to steal. Needless to say, if it would cost a person more than $100 to return $100 he received by mistake, few of us would judge him for simply keeping the money.7",

      "highlight": "The influence of social systems extends far beyond the problem of lying, and I think changing these norms and institutions represents the greatest hope for improving our ethical lives. Imagine, for instance, that a young, white man has been falsely convicted of a serious crime and sentenced to five years in a maximum-security prison. Let’s say this person is highly ethical and has no history of violence. He is, understandably, terrified at the prospect of living among murderers and rapists. When he hears the prison gates shut behind him, a lifetime of diverse interests and aspirations will collapse to a single point: He must avoid making enemies so that he can serve out his sentence in peace. Unfortunately, our hero is about to encounter the limited utility of having a personal ethical code. Prisons are places of perverse incentives, in which the very norms one must follow to avoid becoming a victim lead inescapably toward violence. In most U.S. prisons, for instance, whites, blacks, and Hispanics exist in a state of perpetual war. This young man is not a racist, and he would prefer to interact peacefully with everyone he meets, but if he does not join a gang, he is likely to be targeted for rape and other abuse by prisoners of all races. To not choose a side is to become the most attractive victim of all. Being white, he most likely will have no rational option but to join a white-supremacist gang for protection. So he joins a gang. In order to remain a member in good standing, however, he must be willing to defend other gang members, no matter how sociopathic their behavior. He also discovers that he must be prepared to use violence at the tiniest provocation—returning a verbal insult with a stabbing, for instance—or risk acquiring a reputation as someone who can be assaulted at will. To fail to respond with overwhelming force to the first sign of disrespect is to run an intolerable risk of further abuse. Thus, the young man begins behaving in precisely those ways that make every maximum-security prison a hell on earth. He also adds further time to his sentence by committing serious crimes behind bars. A prison is perhaps the easiest place to see the power of bad incentives. And yet in many walks of life, we find otherwise normal men and women caught in the same trap and busily making the world much less good than it could be. Elected officials ignore long-term problems because they must pander to the short-term interests of voters. People working for insurance companies rely on technicalities to deny desperately ill patients the care they need. CEOs and investment bankers run extraordinary risks—both for their businesses and for the economy as a whole—because they reap the rewards of success",

This is a case in which you are surrounded by people you do not trust—or, rather, whom you would trust to behave irrationally and unethically if they were to learn the truth about you. This is one of the most noxious things about religious faith and about any community based on it. Whatever its imagined virtues, faith is the enemy of open and honest inquiry.

Ask him to reach behind a partition and select with his left hand (which is predominantly controlled by the right hemisphere) the thing that he “did not see,” and he will succeed in picking out an egg from among a multitude of objects. Ask him to name the item he now holds in his left hand without allowing the left hemisphere to get a look at it, and he will be unable to reply.

      "highlight": "Imagine undergoing a complete callosotomy. Like most such surgeries, you could be kept awake, because there are no pain receptors in the brain. There is also no reason to think that you would lose consciousness during the procedure, because a person can have an entire hemisphere removed (hemispherectomy) without loss of consciousness.44 Nor would you suffer a lapse in memory. After surgery, you would tend to speak in a way characteristic of alexithymia (the inability to describe your emotional life), and you might also demonstrate an inappropriate degree of politeness.45 Whether or not you had occasion to notice these changes in yourself, it seems all but certain that you would retain your sense of being a “self” throughout the experience. Given that each hemisphere in your divided brain would have its own point of view, whereas now you appear to have only one, it is natural to wonder which side of the longitudinal fissure “you” would find yourself on once the corpus callosum was cut. Would you land on the right or on the left? It is hard to resist the uncanny demands of arithmetic here. Assuming that you were not simply extinguished and replaced by two new subjects—which seems ruled out by the fact that you would probably remain conscious throughout the procedure and retain your memories—it is tempting to conclude that your subjectivity must collapse to a single hemisphere. Once the surgery was over, it would be obvious that you can’t be on both sides of the great divide. Perhaps it is reasonable to believe that you would find yourself in the left hemisphere, retaining the reins of speech, since speech and discursive thinking do much to define your experience in the present. But consider some of the other cognitive abilities you now consciously enjoy, which we know are governed primarily by your right hemisphere. Who, for instance, would greet your loved ones with your left hand and effortlessly recognize their faces, their facial expressions, and their tones of voice? I think this riddle admits of a rather straightforward solution. Consciousness—whatever its relation to neural events—is divisible. And just as it isn’t shared between the brains of separate individuals, it need not be shared between the hemispheres of a single brain once the structures that facilitate such sharing have been cut. If some way of linking two brains with an artificial commissure were ever devised, we should expect that what had been two distinct persons would be unified in the only sense that consciousness is ever unified, as a single point of view, and unified in the only sense that minds are ever unified, by virtue of common contents and functional abilities.",

The non-speaking hemisphere has known the true state of affairs from a very tender age. It has known this because beginning at age two or three it heard speech emanating from the common body that, as language development on the left proceeded, became too complex grammatically and syntactically for it to believe it was generating; the same, of course, for what it observed the preferred hand writing down in school through the years. Postsurgically, little has changed for the mute hemisphere (other than loss of sensory information about the ipsilateral half of bodily space). . . . Being inured to this status of cerebral helot, it goes along. Thankless cooperation can become a way of life.48",

      "highlight": "Parfit believes that we should view the teleportation case in which a person is destroyed before being replicated as more or less indistinguishable from the normal pattern of personal survival throughout our lives. After all, in what way are you subjectively the same as the person who first picked up this book? In the only way you can be: by displaying some degree of psychological continuity with that past self. Viewed in this way, it is difficult to see how teleportation is any different from the mere passage of time. As Parfit says, “I want the person on Mars to be me in a specially intimate way in which no future person will ever be me. . . . What I fear will be missing is always missing. . . . Ordinary survival is about as bad as being destroyed and Replicated.”3 Here, Parfit does not mean “bad” in the sense that we should find these truths depressing. He is merely arguing that ordinary survival from moment to moment is no more demonstrative of personal identity than destruction/replication would be. Parfit’s view of the self, which he appears to have arrived at independently through an immensely creative use of thought experiments, is essentially the same as the one found in the teachings of Buddhism: There is no stable self that is carried along from one moment to the next. I agree with most of what Parfit has to say about personal identity. However, because his view is purely the product of logical argument, it can seem uncannily detached from the reality of our lives. Although experience in meditation may not immediately resolve the teleportation paradox or make it clear why one should care about one’s own future experience any more than that of a stranger, it can make these philosophical problems easier to think about. When talking about psychological continuity, we are talking about consciousness and its contents—the persistence of autobiographical memories in particular. Everything that is personal, everything that differentiates my consciousness from that of another human being, relates to the contents of consciousness. Memories, perceptions, attitudes, desires—these are appearances in consciousness. If “my” consciousness were suddenly filled with the contents of “your” life—if I awoke this morning with your memories, hopes, fears, sensory impressions, and relationships—I would no longer be me. I would be the same as your clone in the teleportation case. My consciousness is “mine” only because the particularities of my life are illuminated as and where they arise. For instance, I currently have an annoying pain in my neck, the result of a martial arts injury. Why is this “my” pain? Why am I the only one who is directly aware of it? These questions are a symptom of confusion. There is no “I” who is aware of the pain. The pain is simply arising in consciousness in the only place it can arise: at the conjunction of this brain and this neck. Where else could this particular pain be felt? If I were cloned through teleportation, an…",

      "highlight": "Breaking the Spell of Negative Emotions Most of us let our negative emotions persist longer than is necessary. Becoming suddenly angry, we tend to stay angry—and this requires that we actively produce the feeling of anger. We do this by thinking about our reasons for being angry—recalling an insult, rehearsing what we should have said to our malefactor, and so forth—and yet we tend not to notice the mechanics of this process. Without continually resurrecting the feeling of anger, it is impossible to stay angry for more than a few moments. While I can’t promise that meditation will keep you from ever again becoming angry, you can learn not to stay angry for very long. And when talking about the consequences of anger, the difference between moments and hours—or days—is impossible to exaggerate. Even without knowing how to meditate, most people have experienced having their negative states of mind suddenly interrupted. Imagine, for instance, that someone has made you very angry—and just as this mental state seems to have fully taken possession of your mind, you receive an important phone call that requires you to put on your best social face. Most people know what it’s like to suddenly drop their negative state of mind and begin functioning in another mode. Of course, most then helplessly grow entangled with their negative emotions again at the next opportunity. Become sensitive to these interruptions in the continuity of your mental states. You are depressed, say, but are suddenly moved to laughter by something you read. You are bored and impatient while sitting in traffic, but then are cheered by a phone call from a close friend. These are natural experiments in shifting mood. Notice that suddenly paying attention to something else—something that no longer supports your current emotion—allows for a new state of mind. Observe how quickly the clouds can part. These are genuine glimpses of freedom. The truth, however, is that you need not wait for some pleasant distraction to shift your mood. You can simply pay close attention to negative feelings themselves, without judgment or resistance. What is anger? Where do you feel it in your body? How is it arising in each moment? And what is it that is aware of the feeling itself? Investigating in this way, with mindfulness, you can discover that negative states of mind vanish all by themselves.",

The kettlebell handle passes above the knees during the backswing. The working arm is straight at the bottom position. There is no forward knee movement on the upswing. The body forms a straight line at the top of the swing. The hips and knees fully extend; the spine is neutral. The kettlebell forms an extension of the forearm at the top of the swing; the arm is almost straight. Inhale on the way down; forcefully exhale on the way up.

But conversely, if an assumption is made about the size and strength of the singing bird, then that will help extract nuances in the fast scale dynamics of the song, which could otherwise be lost in noise.

For example, I could model outcomes in terms of the toss of a coin or the throw of a die. The coin and die correspond to models of observed outcomes. For each model there are a number of hypotheses—for example, the best hypothesis for explaining my observations under a coin model is that the coin came up tails. Throughout this book, we will be dealing largely with hypotheses, h, under a model, m, that is assumed by the agent in question.",

If it is so engaged, then positing the source of the constraints as the explanation of perceptual inference does not amount to a reductive analysis it is circular or leads to a regress.

      "highlight": "The urge to explain away. An extreme example of the bottom-up–top-down dynamic may be seen in a well-known hallucinatory effect: cut a table tennis ball in two halves and put them on each eye, and listen to white noise on the radio and relax for a while (e.g., 30 mins). Many people will experience a range of different auditory and visual hallucinations such as simple auditory experiences (beeping, dripping, low grumbles, rustling, hissing), complex auditory experiences (trains, laughter, waterfall, roller-skates, music, party), as well as simple visual experiences (mist, dark patches, flashes of light, blue and yellow lights) and complex visual experiences (ambulances, planes taking off, faces, rising water). People also have bodily experiences (tilting, sinking, weightlessness, being squashed, detached from the body, floating) (Lloyd, Lewis et al. 2012). This effect is often labelled ‘sensory deprivation’ but in reality there is still stimulation of the senses by white noise and the creation of a diffuse bright, visual Ganzfeld (i.e., the expanse of the table tennis balls filling the entire visual field). What does happen is that signal quality is severely deteriorated. Viewed from a prediction error perspective, this drives the participant to expect imprecision and shut down the gain on prediction error. In turn, top-down predictions are given an inordinate weight in perceptual inference. These inferences are now not supervised precisely by the current sensory input and therefore become hallucinations. It seems that even under extremely poor conditions of sensory input, there is an urge to engage in perceptual inference, even if it is almost completely unsupervised. The brain will jump to any conclusion to make sense of its environment.",

The emerging picture is that the organism needs to alternate between perceptual and active inference; it needs to assess precisions optimally so as to efficiently balance sensory sampling against reliance on prior belief; it needs to balance the complexity of its models against their accuracy and usefulness in active inference. All of these processes involve context-dependence and depend on prior learning. Architecturally, generative models are maintained in a perceptual hierarchy that makes sense of our first-person perspective and which reconceives sensory input as, functionally speaking, a feedback signal on the predictions based on the generative model.",

Yatima hesitated, then followed their scent. It was an old outlook, buried in the Ashton-Laval library, copied nine centuries before from one of the ancient memetic replicators that had infested the fleshers. It imposed a hermetically sealed package of beliefs about the nature of the self, and the futility of striving . . . including explicit renunciations of every mode of reasoning able to illuminate the core beliefs’ failings. Analysis with a standard tool confirmed that the outlook was universally self-affirming. Once you ran it, you could not change your mind. Once you ran it, you could not be talked out of it.",

The sun.’ The stars. The stars. When they weren’t speechless with joy over parallax shifts, they were mesmerised by the fluctuations of variable stars, or the slow orbits of a few easily resolved binaries. The polis was too small to be equipped with serious astronomical facilities, and in any case the Star Puppies stuck slavishly to their limited, mock-biological vision. But they basked in the starlight, and revelled in the sheer distance and time scales of the journey, because they’d reshaped their minds to render every detail of the experience endlessly pleasurable, endlessly fascinating, and endlessly significant.",

Meanwhile, the audience takes notes on how the presenter’s performance went, and afterward they practice giving feedback.",

Upon emerging from the jhānas—preferably the fourth or higherf—you begin doing an insight practice with your jhānically concentrated, indistractable mind.g This is the heart of the method the Buddha discovered—these states are not an end in and of themselves, unlike what his two teachers had taught him shortly after he’d left home to begin his spiritual quest.7 They are simply a very useful way of preparing your mind, so you can more effectively examine reality and discover the deeper truths that lead to liberation. a.",

He always carries a notebook with him and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the “permanent” category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. On top of that, the strict chronological order does not offer any help to find, combine or rearrange ideas in a productive sense.

Classitis may result in classes that are individually simple, but it increases the complexity of the overall system. Small classes don’t contribute much functionality, so there have to be a lot of them, each with its own interface. These interfaces accumulate to create tremendous complexity at the system level.

The best way to do this is by redefining semantics to eliminate error conditions. For exceptions that can’t be defined away, you should look for opportunities to mask them at a low level, so their impact is limited, or aggregate several special-case handlers into a single more generic handler. Together, these techniques can have a significant impact on overall system complexity.",

It’s fine to put off all thoughts about a particular abstraction until it’s needed by a feature. Once you need the abstraction, invest the time to design it cleanly; follow the advice of Chapter 6 and make it somewhat general-purpose.",

Exposed instance variables mean that part of the class’s implementation is visible externally, which violates the idea of information hiding and increases the complexity of the class’s interface. Getters and setters are shallow methods (typically only a single line), so they add clutter to the class’s interface without providing much functionality. It’s better to avoid getters and setters (or any exposure of implementation data) as much as possible.",

First, the measurements will identify the places where performance tuning will have the biggest impact. It isn’t sufficient just to measure the top-level system performance. This may tell you that the system is too slow, but it won’t tell you why. You’ll need to measure deeper to identify in detail the factors that contribute to overall performance; the goal is to identify a small number of very specific places where the system is currently spending a lot of time, and where you have ideas for improvement. The second purpose of the measurements is to provide a baseline, so that you can re-measure performance after making your changes to ensure that performance actually improved. If the changes didn’t make a measurable difference in performance, then back them out (unless they made the system simpler). There’s no point in retaining complexity unless it provides a significant speedup. 20.3",

Even though any one point can move up or down as it likes, the overall behavior of the string is constrained by being tied down at either end. As a result, the string only vibrates at certain special wavelengths, or combinations thereof; that’s why the strings on musical instruments emit clear notes rather than an indistinct noise. These special vibrations are called the modes of the string. The essentially “quantum” nature of the subatomic world, in this picture, comes about not because reality is actually subdivided into distinct chunks but because there are natural vibrational modes for the waves out of which physical systems are made.",

As a result, America’s power grid relies on railroads and pipelines to move fuels over long distances to power plants, and then on transmission lines to move electricity over short distances to the cities that need it. That model doesn’t work with solar and wind. You can’t ship sunlight in a railcar to some power plant; it has to be converted to electricity on the spot. But most of America’s sunlight supply is in the Southwest, and most of our wind is in the Great Plains, far from many major urban areas.",

At these temperatures, the particles are moving so fast that they hit each other and fuse together, just as the hydrogen atoms in the sun do. When the hydrogen particles fuse, they turn into helium, and in the process they release a great deal of energy, which can be used to generate electricity. (Scientists have various ways of containing the plasma; the most common methods use either powerful magnets or lasers.)",

Piaget’s great insight was that knowledge is not delivered from teacher to learner; rather, children are constantly constructing knowledge through their everyday interactions with people and objects around them. Seymour’s constructionism theory adds a second type of construction, arguing that children construct knowledge most effectively when they are actively engaged in constructing things in the world. As children construct things in the world, they construct new ideas and theories in their minds, which motivates them to construct new things in the world, and on and on.",

One could pursue this question by studying the rider to find out what special attributes (speed of reaction, complexity of brain functioning, intensity of motivation) contribute to his performance. This inquiry, interesting though it might be, is irrelevant to the real solution to the problem. People can ride bicycles because the bicycle, once in motion, is inherently stable. A bicycle without a rider pushed off on a steep downgrade will not fall over; it will run indefinitely down the hill. The geometrical construction of the front fork ensures that if the bicycle leans to the left the wheel will rotate to the left, thus causing that bicycle to turn and produce a centrifugal force that throws the bicycle to the right, counteracting the tendency to fall. The bicycle without a rider balances perfectly well. With a novice rider it will fall. This is because the novice has the wrong intuitions about balancing and freezes the position of the bicycle so that its own corrective mechanism cannot work freely. Thus learning to ride does not mean learning to balance, it means learning not to unbalance, learning not to interfere. What we have done here is understand a process of learning by acquiring deeper insight into what was being learned. Psychological principles had nothing to do with it. And just as we have understood how people ride bicycles by studying bicycles, Piaget has taught us that we should understand how children learn number through a deeper understanding of what number is.",

The Turtle environments gave us examples of “artificial” (that is, deliberately invented) Piagetian material. Pairings and Turtles both owe their mathetic power to two attributes: Children relate to them, and they in turn relate to important intellectual structures. Thus pairing and Turtles act as transitional objects.

At first, Gmail allowed users to use labels only as tags (hereafter tag-labels); users could (and still can) add as many tag-labels as they wanted to an email, thus allowing multiple classification. This tag-label method did not move emails from the single repository where they were contained—that is, the inbox (see figure 6.1). Beginning in 2009, Gmail also allowed users to use labels as folders (hereafter folder-labels). With folder-labels, participants can drag emails from the inbox “into” a label (see figure 6.2). Folder-labels are single classification, because an email receives only one tag. After being dragged to a label, the email disappears from the inbox and loses its “Inbox” tag; moreover, if dragged into a second label, it loses the previous one. As with folders, the user needs to “open” the label and go through the messages it “contains” in order to retrieve the information needed. Therefore, Gmail users currently have two ways of using labels: tag-labeling, in which labels are dragged to an email, and folder-labeling, in which emails are dragged into labels. Regardless of the way that they are categorized, there are two ways of retrieving email: by using a location (i.e., opening a label in a folder-navigation-like way) or by using non-location-based search (via either tags or other",

It’s the additional step of putting an item into a few buckets that’s difficult / time consuming.A logging workflow in Roam gets around this too. If you’re working inside a nested log, then every block gets tagged with all its parents, and automatically gets a bunch of classifications for free. The tasks given and existing interfaces limit other use cases which multiple classifications could be useful for. This section was only considering their effectiveness for storing and retrieving individual items. But what about exploration and serendipity? I may generally only search by one tag at a time, but noticing a second tag on an item might prompt me to check out items under that tag as well. When you’re not sure what you’re looking for, dense connection between your notes and note spaces may be useful for exploration.",

The router must decide how to forward each packet as it arrives, which requires a forwarding table that specifies, for each destination address (or cluster of addresses), the preferred path toward that destination. In order to construct this table, routers (in addition to forwarding packets) continuously compute the best routes to all the addresses in the network. This process requires that the routers send messages to other routers describing what links in the Internet are currently in operation and which routers they connect. This exchange enables a collective decision, the routing computation, to select the best overall routes. Routers perform this task in the background at the same time that they forward packets. If a communication link fails or a new one is installed, this routing computation will construct new routes as appropriate. This adaptation improves the Internet’s robustness in the face of failure.",

Since Internet does not insist that lost packets be recovered at the network level, it may be necessary to retransmit a lost packet from one end of the Internet to the other. This means that the retransmitted packet may cross several intervening nets a second time, whereas recovery at the network level would not generate this repeat traffic. This is an example of the tradeoff resulting from the decision, discussed above, of providing services from the end-points.",

How often will data be sufficiently popular that short-term caching (in the routers of the network) will be effective?

With the new service-based software architecture in place, any team could simply refer to the published application programming interfaces (APIs) for other teams. (More on this new software architecture to follow.) Be evaluated by a well-defined “fitness function.” This is the sum of a weighted series of metrics. Example: a team that is in charge of adding selection in a product category might be evaluated on: a)  how many new distinct items were added for the period (50 percent weighting) b)  how many units of those new distinct items were sold (30 percent weighting) c)  how many page views those distinct items received (20 percent weighting) Be monitored in real time. A team’s real-time score on its fitness function would be displayed on a dashboard next to all the other two-pizza teams’ scores. Be the business owner. The team will own and be responsible for all aspects of its area of focus, including design, technology, and business results. This paradigm shift eliminates the all-too-often heard excuses such as, “We built what the business folks asked us to, they just asked for the wrong product,” or “If the tech team had actually delivered what we asked for and did it on time, we would have hit our numbers.” Be led by a multidisciplined top-flight leader. The leader must have deep technical expertise, know how to hire world-class software engineers and product managers, and possess excellent business judgment. Be self-funding. The team’s work will pay for itself. Be approved in advance by the S-Team. The S-Team must approve the formation of every two-pizza team.",

      "highlight": "Apple’s spreadsheet app, Numbers, offers two separate actions for adding rows in general, one for below the current row and one for above (and correspondingly for adding columns). These actions are bound to keyboard shortcuts, so extending a range should be quick and easy. Selecting the last row of a range and adding a row below it should include the new row in the range, but selecting the row one below the range and adding a row above it should exclude the new row from the range. This might sound complicated, but it’s actually very intuitive: if your selection is on one of the rows in the range, then whatever action you perform, whether adding a row above or below, the new row should be in the range. But if you start outside the range, the new row should also be outside. This in fact was exactly how Numbers used to behave (in the 2009 version). The current version treats the first and last row of the range differently. If you add a row above the first row or below the last row, it will not be in the range, irrespective of which row was selected and which row addition action (add above or add below) you performed. This misfit is a major annoyance in practice. I have a spreadsheet in which I track my billing for consulting projects (Figure 5.12). Each row of the sheet corresponds to a billable period of work, with a summary row that gives the total amount of time spent. Every time I complete a piece of work, I add a row to the sheet. In the old Numbers, I would just select the row representing the last period that I completed, issue the add row below command, and complete the fields in the new row. In the new Numbers, this no longer works. I can add the new row just before the last in the range, and then drag the last row up, placing it before the new row. Or I can add a spurious, empty row after the last entry, and include it in the formula (see the shaded region denoting the formula’s scope in Figure 5.12). This happens to work, but only because the formula that sums the time periods happens to treat the empty cell in the dummy row as a zero. Microsoft Excel, incidentally, has exactly the same flaw (and lacks separate actions for adding rows above or below the current row). The mystery of this misfit is not so much why Apple got it wrong, or even what it might have done to catch it (a careful consideration of the operational principle might have revealed it). More surprising is that Apple’s designers knew the right design, and then apparently forgot about it. Perhaps if Apple’s designers had recorded their insights in a concept catalog their best ideas would have more readily survived the transition from version to version.",
      "note": "Apples numbers had a nice wat to add a row at the bottom of a range, inside it, vs just below the range. But then new versions lost this behaviour. Apparently apple forgot about it!",

      "highlight": "Building the Concept Inventory I mentioned in Chapter 3 how concepts can give you a map of an application—a kind of concept inventory that gives you an overview of its functionality and purposes. Let’s see how this map comes about, using an imaginary app as an illustration. Throughout, I’ll discuss it as if you were designing the app alone; of course, in practice, most design work is done in teams. I’ll also talk only about which concepts to include, ignoring all the critical questions about the actual design of the concepts. Suppose you love bird song, and want to build an app to help people identify birds from their calls. That’s the essential need: someone hears a bird call and wants to know what kind of bird it came from. And presumably people who want this also want to hear the song of a particular bird species. You think about how such an app might work. Maybe a user uploads an audio track, then other people listen to it and make suggestions. Now you start brainstorming some concepts. Before inventing a new one, you try some existing ones for fit. How about the q&a concept used in forums (such as StackExchange, Quora, Piazza, and so on), in which someone asks a question and other people provide answers? In fact, you might ask, why not just use one of those existing apps? Often that will be the best approach to solving a problem. To make sure that it isn’t, you’ll want to note some limitations of the existing solutions and check that they really matter. Perhaps in this case you discover that none of them let you easily upload and playback audio recordings; maybe it’s important to have a nice integration so you can record a song and post it in a few clicks. So now let’s suppose you’ve convinced yourself you need to design a new app, and you have some seed concepts, such as q&a and recording. What additional concepts are necessary to make a coherent app? Obviously, since you’re relying on crowdsourcing, you’ll want some concept for achieving consensus, so you might add upvote so that users can approve an answer. As you brainstorm how your app will be used, you realize that you’ll need to somehow consolidate the bird identifications. Users will likely want to search for particular species, and listen to recordings for which there are confirmed matches. So you tentatively add an identification concept, unsure of exactly how it will work. Perhaps when a user answers a question, they can propose an identification by inserting a hashtag, and your app will automatically extract links between species and recordings from the upvoting of answers.80 Finally, you decide to add user to authenticate contributions. At this point, you have the rough outline of an app: BirdSong 0.1.",

It is a side effect of the way her mind works, spinning off new metaphors and turns of phrase at the most unexpected times: “I’m inspired to write songs at any time of day, when I’m going through something or when the dust has settled and I’m over it. It can be anything. I’ll just be doing dishes or something, or in the middle of an interview, and I could get an idea in my head that just kind of sticks out as, ‘That could be a hook, that could be a pre-chorus, that’s a first line.’ ” She goes on to explain why it’s so important to her to capture those fleeting thoughts right as they appear: “I kind of have to capitalize on the excitement of me getting that idea and see it all the way through or else I’ll leave it behind and assume it wasn’t good enough.”",

For example, it uses past velocity, direction headings, fuel levels, and the like to recommend how a space shuttle should be steered at the current timestep. Crucially, if the microhistory is not accurate enough, if the confidence intervals around each measurement are too wide, or if (say) the velocity estimate is wrong altogether, then the Kalman Filter does not work and Apollo doesn’t happen.",

The sense of urgency was good for its own sake. It made his engineers engage in first-principles thinking. But as Mueller points out, it was also corrosive. “If you set an aggressive schedule that people think they might be able to make, they will try to put out extra effort,” he says. “But if you give them a schedule that’s physically impossible, engineers aren’t stupid. You’ve demoralized them. It’s Elon’s biggest weakness.”",

      "highlight": "In the case of the launch failure, it became evident that the leak had come from a small B-nut that secured a fuel line. Musk fingered an engineer named Jeremy Hollman, one of Mueller’s first hires, who, the night before the launch, had removed and then reattached the nut in order to get access to a valve. At a public symposium a few days later, Musk described the mistake by “one of our most experienced technicians,” and insiders knew he was referring to Hollman. Hollman had stayed behind in Kwaj for two weeks to analyze the debris. On his flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles, he was reading news stories about the failure and was shocked to see that Musk had blamed him. As soon as he landed, he drove the two miles from the airport to SpaceX headquarters and barged into Musk’s cubicle. A shouting match erupted, and both Shotwell and Mueller went over to try to calm things down. Hollman wanted the company to retract Musk’s statement, and Mueller pressed for permission to do so. “I’m the CEO,” Musk replied. “I’m the one that deals with the press, so stay out of it.” Hollman told Mueller he would stay at the company only if he never had to deal directly with Musk. He left SpaceX a year later. Musk says he doesn’t remember the event, but he adds that Hollman was not a great engineer. Mueller disagrees: “We lost a good guy.” As it turned out, Hollman was not at fault. When the fuel line was found, part of the B-nut was still attached, but it was corroded and had cracked in half. The sea air of Kwaj was to blame.",
