After a short conversation with claude and some googling I'm feeling more optimistic re job prospects. Also feeling like I shouldn't over-index on anything right now. Spend some time exploring options, but also writing/introspecting about what I want. I think this process will resolve around some specific criteria and options that I can execute around.
