Once I'm awake and had my coffee, my brain is turned on, and now I'm motivated to do stuff. No motivation for that when I was lying in bed. And now this me wants as much time as it can to mess around with whatever.  

What's the lesson there?
It could be something like: "Hey in-bed-self, I know it's super cozy, but you have an opportunity to do a *great thing* for morning taylor. With just a little bit of effort, you can give him a lot more time an enjoyment. You're doing real *good* by getting out of bed. How about it bro?"
