## What is opening awareness?

> Opening awareness is a path of meditation that leads to better ways of being in the world: passionate, accurate, and spontaneous.
> Opening awareness is a meditation path that leads to spacious clarity: experiences of continuous, vivid appreciation of what is happening.
> The overall aim of the path is passionate engagement with the fullness of life.

Between these two, you get a gist. If you want to be more "passionate, accurate, and spontaneous" then you can get those by developing "spacious clarity", which this path helps cultivate.

> This book is a detailed, practical manual for opening awareness meditation

> Different systems produce different alterations in conscious experience, and different transformations in your self and the way you feel and act in the world. [...] Do you want the lifestyle a particular system encourages?

> Some different outcomes various systems promise include:
> - Non-self, or True Self, or Cosmic Oneness
> - Unchanging content-free consciousness without sensory awareness—or vivid perceptual awareness in dynamically evolving situations
> - Immunity to suffering—or compassion for the inevitable suffering of all sentient beings, including oneself
> - Concentrated, focused attention control—or panoramic, open awareness

> In Evolving Ground we draw attention to two broad categories: renunciative views and life-affirming views.

renunciative views:
- emotions, self, and suffering are inherently problematic obstacles
- aim to overcome suffering with meditation
- lead to enlightenment

life-affirming views:
- emotions, self, and suffering are natural and pervasive aspects of human experience
- aim to befriend emotions and self, and to be present with suffering and enjoyment


Many meditation paths aim to get rid of the self. This path

## Opening awareness doesn't aim to get rid of the self

> Many meditation paths emphasize a changing experience of the self.

> The experience of the self in opening awareness is not emphasized over any other experience. Awareness does increase experiential understanding of the transitory, nebulous nature of all phenomena, including your self. 

Opening awareness does not denigrate the self, but rather brings spacious clarity to it, as it does with all concepts. Bringing spacious clarity to the self allows you to "become more adaptable, flexible, fluid, responsive, and free."

A summary of the practice from Claude:
- Sit comfortably with a relaxed, upright posture.
- Remain uninvolved with whatever arises in experience. This means not engaging with or manipulating thoughts, sensations, emotions, etc. as they naturally occur.
- Include everything in awareness without preference or judgment. Allow all experiences to come and go freely.
- Maintain a light, relaxed awareness without concentrating on any particular object or trying to achieve a specific state.
- When you notice you've become involved in thoughts/emotions, gently return to open, uninvolved awareness.

The practice seems very similar to the "do nothing" practice in Shinzen Young's Unified Mindfulness.

> The method is simple: sit down and remain uninvolved with whatever arises.

If Shinzen Young read this, would he describe the state of "spacious clarity" as "high concentration, sensory clarify, and equinimity"? Or maybe he would say it's a subset of those, or a particular emphasis of them.

> However, opening awareness leads to spacious clarity, within which we perceive all of life with new, more vivid accuracy.

> Opening awareness trains us, through remaining temporarily uninvolved during


## An attempt to summarize the book

It claims:
- There's a state of mind they call "spacious clarity" that's a better way of being in the world. We're more passionate, accurate, and spontaneous.
- Spacious clarity can be cultivated through practice. They use the term "opening awareness" to describe the practice of cultivating spacious clarity (and maybe also to refer to the state?).
- A practice of siting down and remain uninvolved with whatever arises can cultivate spacious clarity.

> Ordinarily we find ourselves involved with experience automatically. [...] we can’t resist elaborating whatever is occurring in our minds—by multiplying ideas, thought-stories, and imaginings.
> “Remaining uninvolved” is to experience whatever is happening without engaging, elaborating, focusing, or acting in response.
> As elaboration subsides—but awareness remains—experience becomes unexpectedly simple, clear, and immediate.

key terms: remaining uninvolved, elaboration

There's a frame here where contents of the mind arise from (the unconcious?) and then "we" elaborate on them. Like a stream of consciousness gets kicked off by an initial "thought" that comes from outside ourselves, and then "we" attach on and elaborate. We don't notice we're doing this.

I feel like there's a lot packed into this frame that can go by quikly and is hard to hold on to. .e.g distinction between "me" and "unconscious" or "me" and "outside of me". Thoughts arise on their own, but then can be propagated by "getting involved". By doing a doing (while the initial thought wasn't done by anything). 

And then there's this claim I guess that "we" or "I" do this too much. We automatically do this elaboration or "getting involved" with whatever arises. This takes away the agency "I" have over my next thoughts and actions.
