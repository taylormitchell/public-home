rest has a texture to it

while in a restful state, we tried meditating on thoughts. watching them and allowing them to do what they want. if I didn't engage, I found they would pass by quickly. If I did, I'd lose the meditation frame completely and be lost in thought. 

    I thought we were trying to get into a state where thoughts would arise and continue propagate while we watch them, 

    but Kevin said that the fact thoughts would fade away is the insight 

    Part of me is wanting that state though. A state of mind where one where thoughts arise, propagate, produce insights, etc, but with enough detachment and lightness that I can choose to step away
