My whole digital life organized into a single system. 
The metadata layer on top of everything, within which you can organize everything. 
It’s assumed that most of your data lives elsewhere. That’s fine. So most objects within this system are wrappers around remote files. 

 
The primary concepts are objects and links (equivalent to nodes and edges in a graph)

An object has a body / content. That can be a value or a reference to a file that lives elsewhere. 

Links tie two objects together. Links can have a label. 

Objects can have attributes.
Some attributes are built in:
- up/down vote
- due date

Maybe there are types too? And implements / inherits. Initially they could just be something to query against. Like labels? Later they can enforce schemas. This is what Tana does, right?

How far could you get by copying the structures of typescript?
