With 5+ years of engineering experience across high-impact projects, I'm excited about scaling Alan's engineering community. 

At Ideaflow, I led technical interviews, created our onboarding program, and implemented engineering best practices that unified our development process across teams. 

My background spans Python and JavaScript development, from building real-time collaborative editors to optimizing large-scale ETL pipelines. 

I've demonstrated my ability to tackle complex technical challenges while mentoring others â€“ at IBM, I founded a mentorship program supporting dozens of engineers, and at Ideaflow, I shaped product design alongside the CEO while rapidly iterating on implementation through to a successful Product Hunt launch. 

I'm particularly drawn to Alan's focus on mission and excellence. I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my craft and help others grow, and I'm excited to do that at Alan.
