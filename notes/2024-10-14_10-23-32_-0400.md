PREDICTIVE CODING APPROXIMATES BACKPROP ALONG ARBITRARY COMPUTATION GRAPHS
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04182

> predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory of cortical computation which relies solely on local and Hebbian updates

> a consensus has emerged that the brain cannot directly implement backprop, since to do so would require biologically implausible connection rules (Crick, 1989)

no one thinks the brain can backprop 

> In this paper we extend this work, showing that predictive coding can not only approximate backprop in MLPs, but can approximate automatic differentiation along arbitrary computation graphs. This means that in theory there exist biologically plausible algorithms for differentiating through arbitrary programs, utilizing only local connectivity

they show the brain can backprop

> Predictive coding views the brain as composed of multiple hierarchical layers which predict the activities of the layers below.

> Predictive coding possesses a wealth of empirical support

> Moreover, the central role of top-down predictions is consistent with the ubiquity, and importance of, top-down diffuse connections between cortical areas

> our algorithm is substantially more expensive than backprop which limits the scalability of our method
