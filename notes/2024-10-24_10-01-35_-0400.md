Update my resume and LinkedIn
Maybe apply to a stripe job
Probably start a spreadsheet

The job doesn’t need to be perfect! Don’t overthink things. Just get going. If you “waste” an application on a place you kinda want, it’s no big deal. There are other options. My current pursuits aren’t career driven. The particulars of the job don’t matter all that much. I just need one that meets my needs, provides some career growth, and allows space for me to do other things.
