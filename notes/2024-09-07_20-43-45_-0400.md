Maybe do:
Stash
Add and commit
Return
Rebase and push

If there’s an issue with the rebase and push, you raise an error for manual intervention. No need to block the request on that though. 

We cooould also do the pushing with a cron. But I kinda like it happening right away

Maybe you can start a separate process which watches the git repo and does rebase+push after every commit. 

Deploy script could deploy both. 

It’s kind nice to keep it separate. Like the api will serve and commit what it has, but it doesn’t give you guarantees you’re synced. It could’ve diverged. But that doesn’t stop it from serving requests. 

The process which rebases and pushes is the one which would notify me if there’s an issue. If there is, I can ssh to it and manually resolve.
