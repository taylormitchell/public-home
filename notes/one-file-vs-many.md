# One file vs many

- By organizing resources in a file, I have more control over the layout and context compared to using a filesystem. Like in vscode, I've got a lot of files and directories in my field of view. I wish I could pair it down / zoom in like I can in finder. I could construct this manually in a file if that was my primary organizational method.
- Right now I have a "meditation" file in my gtd file and separately a "meditations" journal and notes. Instead, I could put these together, where file names / directories are more about conceptual groupings / giving names to things. Then separately you can have index files which organize those files and directories based on use cases e.g. todos, notes, etc. [](digital-home.md)

- I can link to individual thoughts/ideas. But I can do that with headings within markdown files
- I can trigger events in response to new files. Yes but also if I'm tracking things with git, I can use file changes to trigger reactions to e.g. if I wanted an LLM to read my new files and do stuff with them, it could do that with file changes too.
