Maybe in my summaries, I should prompt the AimI for questions or next actions that came up. 

Hmmâ€¦ I feel like the generalization of this is just an AI you can take to however. Like maybe instead of crafting great prompts or whatever, I just give it the tools to pull the data it needs. 

This sounds like fun!
