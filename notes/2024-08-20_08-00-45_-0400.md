Things that are salient right now
- work is annoying
- meditation / [](./relax-happy-achieve.md)
- [engagement](./project-proposal.md)
- being productive outside work / doing stuff outside work / agentic outside work / being alive 
- maybe playing with [](./digital-home.md)

Right in this moment, I'm feeling a little lost generally. It's nice when you wake up in the morning and know exactly what to do either because you're excited about it or cause you know it's important.
There's no momentum behind anything right now. Feels like life outside of work is at a standstill, and I gotta push to get it going, but I dunno where to push.  

Karpathy has some note about learning being difficult, like a workout where you break a sweat. What's the equivalent to that which I could be doing outside of work?
The first thing that comes to mind is prep work for a job search. I mean, I kinda enjoyed that, right? It was fun to practice algorithms and things. I dunno how productive that actually was though.
Feels a bit contrived too. Do I *really* care about that? Or is it just an easy default?

I enjoyed reading through my recent journals.
