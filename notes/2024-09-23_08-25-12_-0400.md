Still feel conflicted / a little lost about what to do. Like it doesn't feel like I've got a clear focus like "job search". Feels like things are turbulent and I'm not sure what the plan is or how to navigate.

Wondering if one thing that could help is really carving out time for those things and treating them as sacred. Give myself time around them to mess around still. But carving out the time means it actually gets done.
