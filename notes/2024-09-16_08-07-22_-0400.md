mixed vs segregated
sometimes I like the idea of having my files mixed together. code, notes, files, etc comingle, maybe organized by topic or project or whatever.
other times I feel like organizing by type. Code, files, notes, etc. 

A couple reasons to segregate:
- Some code projects assume a certain structure (e.g. node projects walk up to node_modules looking for types and can get messed up)
- When generating a git diff for ai to summarize, I'd want to ignore e.g. books I've put in git, which is easier to do if they're all in a directory together.
