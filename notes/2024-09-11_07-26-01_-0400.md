When to use one file vs many?

I've been finding the flow of doing `n post /some/path` a bit cumbersome. While on desktop, it'd be easier just to open up a single file and add a heading for the day / time.

It's kinda the opposite on mobile though where I have a separate app. It's easy to create a file and harder to take a little note and find the right place to put it on a file.

It's a little harder to add a "note" to multiple folders when a "note" is just a section of a file. Now you *can* link to the section, but you can't use symlinks anymore.
