[This](2024-08-28_07-43-32_-0400.md) could be relevant to my next job too. Like maybe I _shouldn't_ get a job at a mid-large company. Maybe I should try riding the AI wave into indie-hacking solo dev. If I can get by + have freedom, that seems good.

One thing about indie-dev is that I don't think I'm very tuned in to what people want. I have little pet projects that niches would like but less on mass/quick things. I know they say these niches can be a wedge for VC-size companies but I dunno if that's still true for indie-devs?

Counter: Seems easier to do the relax part of [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md) in a low-variance / predicable / easy environment. That's the stage I'm at now. Could be harder to do that while also trying to build a bunch of side businesses.
