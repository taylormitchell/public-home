I’ve been thinking about my personal mantra “relax, happy, achieve.” The “relax” part doesn’t mean abandoning goals or lying around doing whatever you feel like. Instead, it means you can be goal-oriented and disciplined while maintaining a relaxed mindset. You can pursue your objectives without getting wound up about them.

Sometimes I conflate this philosophy with David Deutsch’s view that we should be driven by curiosity and follow our creative interests, since it’s hard to predict future knowledge growth. While there’s value in that perspective, it’s actually a separate concept that can be considered independently.

We don’t need to solve everything in life all at once. It’s often easier to navigate life by having clear rules and discipline rather than doing whatever you feel like in the moment. So I’m sticking with being structured and disciplined, but approaching it with a relaxed mindset. This approach makes more sense and is easier to implement.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
