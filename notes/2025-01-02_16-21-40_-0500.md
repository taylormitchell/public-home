react native / personal structured data / todo app

- sqlite on remote server
- replicache syncs to client
- react native app


Do I want to use replicache? Is it the right solution for react native?


If I didn't really care about full offline support, I'd probably do:
- use react query
- when offline, cache changes in local storage
- when online, push changes to server and fetch latest data

But in that set up, I don't have access to the data while offline. Is this reeeeaally a problem though? Maybe I could get away with it.

Long term I probably do want

can I use this extension to send changes to the server, rollback, then apply the server changes on top?
