# Space b/w stimulus and response

One thing we're doing or training during meditation practice is putting a space between stimulus and response. 
Examples of this are avoiding scratching the nose when it's itchy, or not sneezing.
An sensory event arises that usually triggers a response. Instead, we notice the event without acting on it. 
This practice improves our CCE but also is a useful skill in it's own right.

Is there a conflict / difference between this and the mode we're in during auto-do/speak/think?
Kevin's got some thoughts on this but not super confident.
In his view there is a difference. 
It's something like: once you've put a gap b/w stimulus and response with awareness stilling in the middle, 
you're presented with an opportunity.
From here, you can intentionally act/do/speak.
But you can also just let a auto action come into that space. 
This is coming from a different part of your mind than the one that produces an auto response to a stimulus when there's no gap.

^ This feels a little sketchy to me but also seems coherent.

The scatteredness of the mind during longer sittings is a spacious thing. Something to notice.

something about see hear feel practice
once an event is gone, we can either:
- continue focusing on the new content at the spotlight of attention
- let attention move to another sensory event

relaxed concentration
