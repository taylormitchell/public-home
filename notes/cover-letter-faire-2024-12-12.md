Dear Faire Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the Senior Full-stack Engineer position on the Retailer Growth team. I believe in technology's power to empower and transform, so Faire's mission to help local retailers thrive through innovative tools resonates with me.

At Ideaflow, I straddled product and engineering roles while leading our Product Hunt launch, which became the day's highest-voted product. This required rapidly developing and scaling our infrastructure while shipping a responsive mobile version with minimal codebase changes. Working closely with our CEO and design lead, I shaped product direction and technical specifications, balancing user needs with engineering constraints. As a seniour engineer, I was integral in building the apps Notion-like document editor using TypeScript and React, focusing on performance optimization and responsive design.

Previously at IBM Consulting, I gained valuable experience collaborating with diverse teams and stakeholders while delivering enterprise-scale solutions. I demonstrated technical leadership by optimizing our ETL pipeline to achieve a 10x throughput improvement, significantly enhancing our data processing capabilities. Beyond technical contributions, I showed my commitment to team growth by founding and leading mentorship programs, helping junior engineers develop their skills and advance their careers.

I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to Faire's mission of empowering independent retailers. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience aligns with your team's needs.

Best regards,
Taylor Mitchell
