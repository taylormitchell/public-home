notes - flat directory of text files, with a prefix timestamp for sorting

(Maybe notes should be at the root directory? That way links are always absolute?)

data - used by personal apps for persistence

files - large files of any type. Not version controlled

packages - distinct code packages, organized with subfolders

scripts - one-off scripts

Files are organized into top-level directories based on practical considerations around file systems, version control, code tools, etc. 

For example, it’s often nice to have notes ordered by creation date. But because we use version control, we can’t trust the creation date on the file itself. So we put a prefix on the date which allows reverse chronological sorting.

Data files could go here too, but in these cases the sorting isn’t as important, so no need to shoehorn it in when you don’t want to

The “files” directory is for large things like images and videos which are unreasonable to version control. Probably a symlink to Dropbox. 

You *could* put files and data together, but often my data is small enough that it can be version controlled by git. Splitting by directory is an easy way to tell give what to version control and what not too. 

The term “packages” is common for src code in a monorepo.
