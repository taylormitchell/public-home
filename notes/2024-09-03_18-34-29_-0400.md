Proposal thoughts
Candle lit something on the balcony or patio (private plus could hook something up to capture the moment)
Could be cold out
I don’t think she wants it in a public place
Could go to someone’s place? Then they “leave” but really they’re close by to take photos
Do it in the apartment and have photographer hiding somewhere
Rings is inside a pickle
Incorporate photos somehow. Like a scrapbook?
