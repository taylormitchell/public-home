Practice of focusing on a single thing felt good. I haven't done that in a while. Good for training concentration skills and sensory clarity.

Would be interesting to focus on thoughts directly, and the resistance around them. The resistance around thought is something that I refer to when assessing negative experiences, so makes sense to get better at unpacking it.
