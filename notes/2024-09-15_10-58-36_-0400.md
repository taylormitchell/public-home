A structure for my git controlled personal file system

Taylor/
  files/
  notes/
  code/

The files is a symlink to something like Dropbox. The notes are text files that actually live in the repo. The code is for code which wants to be segregated a certain way for build reasons. 

Iâ€™m not sure about the files part though. Feels like it should be intermixed but use got lfs or something
