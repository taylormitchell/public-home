Did breath counting today. 
I find it a bit easier if you focus on the whole breath sensation, rather than narrowly focusing on e.g. the node or belly.
I'm sure the narrow concentration is practicing a useful skill, but if I just wanna work non-distractedness specifically, a broader focus range seems fine.
