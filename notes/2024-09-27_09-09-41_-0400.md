some conjectures:
mindfullness = CCE = high metacognition ?
grasping is the way the metacognitive process exerts control over the cognitive process
grasping disrupts the flow of thought. this is what it's *trying* to do cause it's trying to change the flow of though. but disrupting that flow causes suffering.
this is based off the Shinzen Young metaphor of thought as a stream and turbulence as suffering.   
grasping injects turbulence leads to suffering.
if you stop grasping completely, there's no suffering. but it also means the metacognitive process has no control over the flow of thought.
imo it shouldn't be stopped completely. it's a matter of degree.
some people like myself over-rely on grasping as a way to navigate the world, unaware that this is causing suffering.
for those people, tamping down grasping is helpful.  
need some metaphor for this. I'm imagining trying to control an untamed horse by whipping it. Another way is to kindly guide the horse, train it, etc. Once you've done that, it only takes light pressure to guide the horse. (I have no idea if this is how horse training works lol)
