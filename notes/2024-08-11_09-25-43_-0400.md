Has to be Mac or else the command key is too far away
I’d prefer not to have the numpad
The escape key should be close

The Logitech Wave Keys seems like best option for a reasonable price. Compact keys with good placement of escape and mod key. I don’t like how there’s a numpad but all the options without numpad are worse in some other way.
