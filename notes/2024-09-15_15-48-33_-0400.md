Maybe as you highlight a book, a markdown note for that book is generated, and the highlights plus notes are appended to it (in the order of the highlights).

See conversation with chatgpt mocking up a chrome extension implementation for this: https://chatgpt.com/c/66e73bd4-7724-800c-8c10-a75d74127b57

You could probably make a chrome extension for highlighting on the web too. Like build readwise but annotations are pesisted in [markdown notes](./digital-home.md)
