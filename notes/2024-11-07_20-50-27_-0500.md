Here's the old text I used for my sabatical:

- I took a sabbatical to learn full-stack web development, as well as exploring areas of interests such as end user programming and tools for thought.
- Designed and built a quick capture web-app using React, Express, and Typescript.
- Created extensions for Roam Research (note-taking web app) written in Javascript which included a command prompt interface, end-user scripting support, and flash card integrations.
