Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Engineer position in Stripe's Payments organization. Stripe's mission to increase the GDP of the internet by enabling millions of businesses to grow and thrive resonates with my desire to build impactful technology.

At Ideaflow, I led the development of complex frontend systems using TypeScript and React, including a Notion-like document editor with optimistic updates and sync. This experience directly relates to building best-in-class checkout experiences. I also led our Product Hunt launch, successfully scaling our infrastructure and rapidly delivering a mobile version with minimal codebase changes â€“ demonstrating my ability to execute under pressure while maintaining high engineering standards.

Previously as consultant at IBM, I designed and implemented REST APIs for mission-critical applications, working closely with frontend teams to define clear interfaces. This experience, combined with my track record of collaborating with stakeholders to balance user needs and engineering constraints, positions me well to contribute to Stripe's frontend platform.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience building robust, user-friendly interfaces can help advance Stripe's mission.
