## Meeting with Piyush

- He's still in Thailand with his girlfriend
- They're gonna move in together in India! Then been together a few months now and just wanna go for it
- Work is fine. Mentioned he's trying to up his throughput a bit. I think he'll be able to.

## thoughts on stream view

### modelling / rendering

instead of a tree, making it a list of subtrees
optionally, it can have a root and ancestors. this is what you see in the outline view
descendant nodes don't have to have a relation to a parent

### positioning

it's not relations and relation lists anymore. can abstract this away?

### qs

- how hard to remove contraint of a relation?
- how hard to abstract positions and updating them?

could you make it so you really do just generate a set of results, and then everything is the same afterwards?

the "root" is some query. that query might be "everything related to X", in which case you show X at the top like a title

### with relations

I could just keep the stream node and relations for now...

### misc

what if when I expand it, it becomes a tree node?

make it so the way you see children is by clicking a button that jumps you to the list workspace

- [x] notes view
  - pinned
  - remove stream view button
- [x] taylor/exact-match-at-top
- [x] setting reactive
- [x] save settings locally
- [x] direction of relation created by @ should be reversed

## misc bug fixes and features

- notes view
- edit button
