## Social stuff

Went to Kevin's parents driveway concert. It was nice to chat with Kevin a bit and see the family. Good excuse to leave the house and go for a walk too.

Hung out with Amy, Lukas, and Aiden. It's fun to see friends! (Less fun being hungover, but it's not too bad).

Survivor at Brian's place. This was fine. I wasn't feeling very talkative though. Felt a bit like an odd-man-out.

## Personal work
- I set up an appointment with Dr. Wilson.
- Connected with Courtney about secrets.
- Sketched out a [job search plan](./project-next-job-2024.md#Plan).

I was mostly on top of my habits this week like anki, gym, and heated eyepatch. Not so much on no twitter or podcasts though. 

## Professional work

I told Jacob that I'll be leaving Ideaflow at the end of the year. His reaction was a bit weird. I don't think he really buys it. He has switched into a more engaged mode though. This is good for the company, but also compelled me to work harder than I've been intendeding too. I think that's ok though, as long as I keep it in check. It would be nice to deliver a product before leaving.
