# Mouse crawl 2024

Annoying parking lot attendant at the Polynesian wouldn’t let us in. Drove to magic kingdom parking lot then took tram to mono rail. Took wrong monorail to magic kingdom. Backtracked all the way around to Polynesian

Bryce ordered 120 caviar. It came with $80 marble spoons. Courtney stole one. When getting on the monorail she got stopped by security! But she got away with it. Like aunt like niece
Contemporary was past last call when we got there. Tried to talk boat to bar at the lodge but it didn’t show up. Headed back to the masters blvd bar.
