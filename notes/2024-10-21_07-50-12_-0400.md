I've been leaning away from organizing files in folder space and instead organizing in hyperlink space. Does this make logseq more appealing? I think that was one of my main knocks against it. (see [here](./2024-07-29T20:25:47.913Z.md))

Like I've already incremented towards something logseq-like. My todos are built around this assumption that that data objects are lines in markdown files. That's what logseq does, but in a more general way.

I wonder if there's an alternative though where we're line-based with ids for lines like logseq, but we're not forcing notes into an outline structure. 

Some cross over with thoughtstream? Jacob would *like* that that just be text files with named relations between them. These named relations could be `<name>[object](url)`. This is a special syntax, but it's on the order of the special syntaxes tools like logseq and obsidian add. Special syntax for line-level links seems allowed too.
