# Priya and Justinâ€™s wedding trip notes

## Wednesday
Woke up at 3:45 ðŸ˜­ for our flight
Guy had heart attack on plane before take-off. He was ok but needed to deplane so delayed an hour
Shuttled to hotel
The resort front entrance is a path with shallow water on both sides. While admiring the ceiling Emily stepped right into the water ðŸ˜‚ . The hotel didnâ€™t have our room ready yet so Emily needed to sit through lunch with soaking shoes! We had lunch with Laura and Carolyn, who are Priyaâ€™s friends from camp. 
Our room had a great view and jacuzzi!
