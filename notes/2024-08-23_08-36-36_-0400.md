meditation

I think I still wanna make meditation primary
I also like the idea of having space to just dick around with my personal projects and stuff. It's more fun than work. Kinda feels more productive too.
So maybe a job that's a bit more lax makes sense. Like aim for a big-tech job.
Should look good on a resume too I assume. 
Regular 40h week hopefully w/ time and energy outside it for other things

Maybe not *so* big tech though? Like find something that's growing? Better for career growth-y things.
Should I care about that though? Isn't AGI coming?

Cool companies to work at that come to mind:
- stripe
- shopify

There's probably a lot of new ones in the AI space.  

Could be fun to learn ruby on rails for shopify. 
Could build some little app with it too. Maybe a gpt wrapper for flashcard generation. Maybe there's an api you can hit too. 
other stuff too?
