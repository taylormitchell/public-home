```ts
    stop() {
      state = "inactive";
      // This is in place of `analyzer.stop()` but it's not the same. I think
      // it's closer to the web's `await stop(); onStopFinished();`
      endiOSRecording(audioId);
      // Applies media recorder state to coordinator state and then notifies
      // ui listeners (I think that's all they are)
      onStateChange();
      // This is attempting to mirror the web media recorder, but in that
      // case there's a separate stop() function that's called. It's not
      // a self call. Not sure what this even does.
      // On web, this tells the encoder worker to stop, waits for it to confirm
      // all chunks are saved, and then stops the stream.
      // TODO: We need to do something similar here. Somehow we need to await
      // until both the audio is stopped in swift (which swift can do) and the
      // audio is saved to idb (which is done in js)

      // onStopFinished is called here on web. It would upload audio to s3,
      // call savedListeners, and then cleanup. The only registered listener
      // is the one in AudioInsertViewWithLocalCache.tsx which creates a transcript
      // TODO:

      cleanupListener();
      cleanup();
      return Promise.resolve();
    },
