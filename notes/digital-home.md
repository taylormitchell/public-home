# Digital Home

A home for my personal digital life. See [README](../README.md) for context.

## todo

### maybe/later
MAYBE create spa which renders my files as html with collapsible sections.

#### B
- MAYBE update nginx config and script. make log. subdomain work.  
- MAYBE make the note week diffs easier to read. group all changes by file. remove unncessary line noise. etc
- MAYBE move repo to "/Users/taylormitchell/home". Going through Code seems weird
#### C
- MAYBE autocomplete in cli {{upvote: 1}}
  - bash completion scripts: https://opensource.com/article/18/3/creating-bash-completion-script
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabtab
- MAYBE separate the log and todo web views into separate apps on separate subdomains
- MAYBE get basic vscode extension working {{upvote: 1}}
- todo stuff: "show recently created todos" (how would I even do that? line history? maybe git diff last X period and parse from there), ignore templates
- Cron logs
- MAYBE string up to claude api e.g. add cli command to summarize last x days
- MAYBE crons?
- MAYBE prefix my posts differently so the most recent ones are at the top
- MAYBE play with a vscode extension to get e.g. absolute path syntax w/ autocomplete and linking. see [convo with claude](https://claude.ai/chat/4c48c54e-bde9-446a-bb95-4e4678b12a8c)
- MAYBE Extend todos convention to support structured log items too. My notes will continue to be free-form, which you can review in full, but some lines will be Logs, which can be parsed to show shorter summaries of the day/week/whatever. Useful for tracking habits too (or maybe this is a separate concept?)
- MAYBE Auto-commit notes
- MAYBE Can I define my own custom prefix for links? Somehow typescript does it. There must be some server+linter thing running. Can I write my own?
