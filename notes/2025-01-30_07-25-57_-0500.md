Thinking about this morning:Why am I working on the [todo app](my-todo-app.md)? 

My thinking was originally focused justifications based on utility / productivity. Those weren't going anywhere. Most likely it's not a good use of time from that perspective. It just takes too much work compared to using existing tools.

Then I started noodling on the app itself, trying to combine it with note-taking and graph ideas. It was fun and engaging to think about! This is the reason to do it. I like doing it :)
