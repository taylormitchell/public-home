# Recovery & Reset (Feb 17th - Mar 16th 2025)

The main focus is recovery and resetting my body and mind. If unsure what to do, do less.

Most days you shouldn't feel obligated to do anything.

Dos: Eat well, sleep well, run, meditate, and relax. (see [below](#health))

Don't: Scroll twitter or listen to podcasts (except while running)

## Health
- [my blueprint](my-blueprint.md)
- Track food, water, fiber, and bowel movements

## Wedding
- Figure out suits for wedding

## Misc todos
- VSS thing for judging
- Anniversary gift
- Research stuff around tgi board


## Maybe/later
- mortage spreadsheet
- play the witness
- I *mostly* want to just be recoverying. If that's all I did, that would be fine. But this break exists b/c of a job change. And the job change is part of me trying to create a better life for myself. So part of what I can be doing is setting the stage, or setting habits, or doing self-work, or whatever to make that better life happen.
