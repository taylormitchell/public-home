In the past, I've tried to solve feeling sleepy in the morning by doing a workout. 
This doesn't tend to stick, cause I end up dreading getting up. Hard to drag myself out of bed.

What if I just go for a walk or something? Like something that's super light and hopefully even
enjoyable, while still getting my body moving and waking me up.
