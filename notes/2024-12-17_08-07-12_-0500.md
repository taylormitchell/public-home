For years I've kept a log about what I'm doing through daily notes in Roam. The structure makes it easy to organize information hierarchically and the daily notes give a light-weight date ordering.

Just now I was thinking it'd be nice to update my [log cli](../packages/note-cli/README.md) to handle project logging too. In some ways this is easier, cause I can just quickly add a line without needing to open up a whole app and start a daily page. But it doesn't have the same natural hierarchy that Roam has. Maybe that's fine though? Like Roam's hierarchy is super useful in the present for structuring context while working, but when referencing it later, I prefer it to be flatter.  

One thing that logging system doesn't capture is the todo-list aspect of the Roam-daily-note-workflow. Like I sketch out my todos for the day in the daily note, and then the note becomes a log as I work. In [my notes](digital-home.md) today, I've got a separation between the todos and logs. There probably _is_ a way to combine these though.
