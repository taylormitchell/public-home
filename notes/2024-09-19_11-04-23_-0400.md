Playing with some editing stuff. I think it would've been good to assign someone to the editing experience. Have them self-assign or create issues that make sense. Have them play with it and notice problems and improve it. Push the responsibility downwards. Atomized tickets doesn't feel right. Maybe this is a limitation from having engs that are too junior? You need to really break things down for them?
