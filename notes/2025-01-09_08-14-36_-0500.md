# Informational interview with Dan Menard on 2025-01-09

Notes from an informational interview I did with Dan Menard on 2025-01-09. Mehyrar connected me with him over linkedin while I was interviewing with shopify.

## Notes

pros and cons?
- be ok with change e.g. lay-offs, big changes to leadership (new cto just changed) 
- remote it great. shopify has it figured out 
- liberally cancel things when they aren't working

mgmt at shopify
- everyone who does mgmt at shopify is great and well supported. Partly because mgmt was thinned out after covid, so only the best remain. Plus some left. It's also harder to move into mgmt now.

cools stuff shopify is doing
- ai is big like everyone. maybe a bit over-hyped though

interview advice?
- stay calm
