Can drizzle do SQLite?

In mobx approach, your interfaces guarantee valid state transitions. 

In db approach, it’s up to you to construct valid state transitions, but the db will throw if they don’t satisfy some constraints 

What am I exploring? Whether an instantdb like interface is ergonomic for app dev and easy to keep consistent. It’s kinda a test of the redux pattern with hooks for reactivity - just over indexedDb 

Every perspective has a query and manual positions. When you rerun the query, if you have a position you use it, if you don’t you use a default. Pinned and notes are special views.
