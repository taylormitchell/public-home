I was feeling in a groove earlier this week and now feel I've been kicked out of it.
Overwhelm for work and stressed out about it.
It's hard to think about other things I want to make progress on in my personal life when that happens. Doing more "work" outside of the job - it feels like I don't have the energy for it. What I crave is an escape.
With that said: this morning I still did my meditation, flashcards, and little eye patch thing. I've also worked out a couple times this week. So I'm not eschewing all my commitments. That's good.
