# Notes from meditation with Kevin

## 2025-02-04
suggested practicing see-hear-feel-in meditation as a way to investigate moments where I'm conflicted about work stuff 
feel-in = emotional experience. it's hard to disentangle from feel-out but possible.
did 6 nails do-nothing practice. lots of day-dreaming and hypnagogic images. this is fine apparently. you can sit straighter if you find you're actually falling asleep.

- levels of sensory experience. are there benefits for focusing on the lower levels?
- talked about and did do-nothing

connection b/w tension in body and mind. can reduce both by relaxing body
does anchoring away create fulfillment b/c the unpleasant thing is taking up less of the experience bandwidth?
during meditation, noticed tension in body while carried away in fantasy

did nurture positive practice
focus on feeling. use mental image or phrase to bring it back
I used the image of reading in the sun in mexico and the word "warmth"
one of the strongest positive feelings I've had while meditating
