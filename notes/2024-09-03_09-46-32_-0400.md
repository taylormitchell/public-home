In gymnastics, if you try to engage your analytical/conscious (not sure of right term here) mind while doing it, you get in the way. You can't actively think your way through skills. But sometimes you want to change your automatic movement pattern for a skill. You can't think your way through the change. You just kinda set an intention to do it a different way, and then hope the body changes accordingly.
In meditation, they talk about do-nothing or auto-whatever. Letting your mind do what it does. I wonder if this is the same thing. Like the idea is that what I'm describing above w.r.t gymnastics actually applies to all situations. The mind tends to get more involved than is useful. Better to let things flow as they do, and only intervene lightly and in-between times.
