TM: I'm going to start looking for a new job soon and I'd like some help thinking it through.

Some background: I'm based in Toronto and went to University of Toronto for mechanical engineering. I worked as a mechanical designer for 2.5 years before quitting w/o another job lined up. The company wasn't doing well, I was unhappy there, so wanted to get out. Data science was all the buzz then so I kinda thought I'd do that. I got hooked up with a company that connects data scientist freelancers with contract work. After a few months I got a project that last ~8 months. Through some luck networking I eventually met someone at IBM's consulting arm and got a job there as a data scientist. I worked there as a data scientist consultant for about 2 years. It was fine at first, but eventually I started to feel unmotivated and unhappy too. I didn't feel I was working on meaningful projects (most of them got cancelled so deliver any value) and I felt I wasn't learning much. Over that time I got more interested in software development generally, and IBM consulting is more a consulting culture and set of practices then it is a software culture. So I felt it wasn't a great institution or set of peers for improving as a software developer. Near the end, I had an inkling I wanted to do full-stack web development. I liked how that skillset allowed you to make tools for yourself. I quit IBM with nothing lined up again, and took a ~6month sabbatical. During that time I messed around with a few different projects, but primarily I was learning full stack web development and building related projects. One of the projects was an extension for a note-taking tool I used, and through that I met other devs doing the same. One of those people ended up connecting me with the founder of my current company, which is building a note-taking tool. It seemed like great opportunity cause the space was something I was interested in and I'd be building skills to build products I was in to. This has been mostly true while I was here, but also pretty quickly I learned that it's a pretty messy organization. The lead engineer was unhappy and didn't get along with the founder. He was also quick to anger and not trusting so it took a while before we got along. Eventually he left, and I took over leading engineering. The founder himself isn't involved in the day-to-day work. He's often flying around the country, going to conferences, meeting with investors and potential hires, etc. The direction and strategy of the company are pretty vague. If he was completely hands off and we could build and lead the company how we like, maybe that would be ok. But it's more like a middle ground where he has very strong opinions about what we build and how, but is both unavailable often and poor at communicating and thinking through his own opinions. So we're often working off of a pretty poor plan and going around in circles. Long story short, I feel like this isn't the place for me, and I'm considering what my next role will be.

I'm pretty open / undecided about what my next job would be, or where I want to take my career. But here are a couple initial things I've jotted down while thinking about it:
- improve at craft (software development)
- work with great team 
- doing something valuable
- I don't wanna do a note-taking start up cause I've kinda lost interest in that category (or rather: I build my own tools for note-taking so wouldn't use the product)
- maybe productivity / devtools, cause I think I understand those better, but I'm flexible
- Want something that doesn't consume all my time and energy. I often fall into a trap with work where it consumes all my energy and don't end up doing anything outside it. I don't like that.
- I'm getting married in ~1 year and then starting a family shortly after.

Ok that feels like a lot already so I'll stop there! That was a bit rambly, but like I said, my thinking on this is pretty undefined right now. I know I want to leave my current job, and I know I need something to do after. But I don't know what exactly I want and I don't know how to think about it. 

Perhaps you could start off by suggesting a framework for making this decision, and maybe some prompts to solicit key information from me? I'm open to other starting points too if you have better ideas

Claude:Thank you for sharing your detailed background and current situation. It's clear you've had a diverse career path and are now at a point where you're looking to make a thoughtful decision about your next move. Let's approach this systematically to help you clarify your thoughts and priorities.
I suggest we use a framework that combines self-reflection, market analysis, and goal-setting. Here's a structure we can follow:

Values and Priorities Assessment
Skills and Interests Inventory
Career Goals (Short-term and Long-term)
Market Opportunities Analysis
Work-Life Balance Considerations
Decision Matrix

Let's start with some prompts to gather more information and help you reflect:

Values and Priorities Assessment:

What are your top 3-5 non-negotiable values in a work environment?
How important is company culture to you, and what specific aspects of culture do you value most?
How do you define "doing something valuable" in your work context?


Skills and Interests Inventory:

What specific technical skills do you feel most confident in right now?
Are there any skills you're particularly eager to develop further?
Outside of work, what topics or activities do you find yourself naturally drawn to?


Career Goals:

Where do you see yourself professionally in 5 years? 10 years?
What level of responsibility are you aiming for in your next role?
Are you interested in leadership positions, or do you prefer to focus on technical work?


Market Opportunities:

What industries or sectors are you most interested in exploring?
Are you open to relocating, or do you prefer to stay in Toronto?
What size of company do you think would suit you best (startup, mid-size, large corporation)?


Work-Life Balance:

How many hours per week are you willing to work in your ideal scenario?
What flexibility do you need in terms of work hours or remote work options?
Considering your upcoming marriage and family plans, what kind of benefits or policies are important to you?


Decision Factors:

What are the top 5 factors you'll consider when evaluating job opportunities?
How would you rank these factors in order of importance?



Once we have your responses to these prompts, we can start to build a clearer picture of what you're looking for and how to approach your job search strategically. We can then use this information to create a decision matrix that will help you evaluate potential opportunities against your priorities.
Would you like to start by addressing these prompts, or do you have any questions about this approach?

TM: 
Values and Priorities Assessment:

What are your top 3-5 non-negotiable values in a work environment?
- I've been listening to podcasts with different company founders. I resonate with the ones who emphasis the balance b/w craft/quality and speed. Like you need both, and they try to foster a company culture that values both highly.
- Work-life balance. In this next stage, I'm not looking to work more than 40h/week
- ??

How important is company culture to you, and what specific aspects of culture do you value most?
- Craft and speed
- Builder / engineering / product culture

How do you define "doing something valuable" in your work context?
- At all my jobs so far, projects were often cancelled or kinda "bullshit" work. Like I don't know if I've actually contributed anything valuable to the world directly. I'm not using "valuable" in some moral importance sense. More in the sense of: did I produce something that was more valuable than the cost of paying me to do it? I think in most of my work so far, the answer has been no. 


Skills and Interests Inventory:

What specific technical skills do you feel most confident in right now?
- Front end web development (typescript, react)
- Some backend (node, aws)
- Some data science (python, pandas)

Are there any skills you're particularly eager to develop further?
- I'd like to continue developing as a full-stack engineer. So a bit of both front end and backend, but I have less backend experience so maybe want to develop there.  

Outside of work, what topics or activities do you find yourself naturally drawn to?
- I'm often building tools for myself around personal productivity. I'm building some tools around a repo of markdown notes right now. 

Career Goals:

Where do you see yourself professionally in 5 years? 10 years?
- I have trouble with this question. Tbh with the rapid progress in AI, I'm very uncertain what the world will look like in 5 years. I think there's a good chance we have AGI by then, at which point it's hard to know what work will be valuable.
- Putting that aside though, I think some combination of product/engineer/management. I think I'd enjoy the combination of product + engineering the most. I could see myself being an individual contributor or leading a team.

What level of responsibility are you aiming for in your next role?
- Probably leading a product team. I wouldn't really want to start there though. I'd like to join a team first and learn their culture a bit. Shortly after I could lead something. 

Are you interested in leadership positions, or do you prefer to focus on technical work?
- I'd like a combintation of the two. Probably leaning towards leadership though.

Market Opportunities:

What industries or sectors are you most interested in exploring?
- No strong opinions yet. 
- I'm interested in both shopify and stripe. Mostly because of their founders and the cultural values they emphasize though.
- Like I said before, maybe like devtools, infra, productivity. In contrast to e.g. social media which I don't know well so wouldn't be good at product there. 

Are you open to relocating, or do you prefer to stay in Toronto?
- Stay in Toronto. Remote or in-person

What size of company do you think would suit you best (startup, mid-size, large corporation)?
- mid-size


Work-Life Balance:

How many hours per week are you willing to work in your ideal scenario?
- 40 hours

What flexibility do you need in terms of work hours or remote work options?
- Flexibility is a nice bonus but a strict 9-6 in-person is fine too.

Considering your upcoming marriage and family plans, what kind of benefits or policies are important to you?
- I'm not too worried about that. We're pretty well off.


Decision Factors:

What are the top 5 factors you'll consider when evaluating job opportunities? How would you rank these factors in order of importance?
1. Company culture: product/engineering/builder culture, care for both craft and speed. Like I want a place that's effective at building stuff and I grow as a builder too.
2. Tempered by work-life balance though. I want to have a life outside of my work. Top-of-mind things outside of work right now are: a contemplative practice (mindfullness/meditation) and family.   
3. Toronto or remote. 
4. I'd like to grow my network through my job. This is something I'm particularly bad at. I don't feel my network has been growing much over the years. 
5. Pay. >=150k CAD

"What opportunities are there for engineers to contribute to product decisions?"
"How does the company support work-life balance?"


Personal Branding:
Update your LinkedIn profile and resume to highlight your full-stack skills and any projects that demonstrate your ability to balance quality and speed. Emphasize your experience with productivity tools, given your interest in that sector.
Consider Contract-to-Hire:
Given your past experiences with job dissatisfaction, you might consider seeking contract-to-hire positions. This arrangement would allow you to experience a company's culture before committing long-term.

Next Steps:

Update your resume and LinkedIn profile to reflect your current skills and career aspirations.
Create a list of target companies that align with your values and interests.
Start reaching out to your network and joining relevant professional groups to expand your connections.
Set up job alerts on platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and niche job boards for dev tools and productivity software.
