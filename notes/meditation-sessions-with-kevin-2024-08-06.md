center of awareness. moving it from the head. put awareness elsewhere enough and eventually it moves. I can't drop the sense of coordinate system. Like it feels intrinsic to experience. I can't notice the feeling of my belly without it feeling like it's sitting at some distance from my head. Play with this though and see if you can drop that feeling of location (aka the location just feels like content and you just don't engage with it)

flow. you're just focusing on the change in experience. the change was always there, you were always noticing it in your usual see, hear, feel. but now we're just focusing attention on the change more. it's a difference in emphasis.

DO A LONGER SIT!!
