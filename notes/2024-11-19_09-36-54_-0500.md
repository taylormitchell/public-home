I just finished a meditation session with Kevin got a little bit. There is a little bit of tension after a while. I think Kevin was getting kind of frustrated with with me or how he was dealing with the situation or something. I was very conceptual with certain things and trying to understand particular, what does fixation mean in meditative terms or contraction or Tana, and then I also kind of presented this frame like this thing that meditation suggest we do less of we should have less resistance to experience or less fixation, and that will be less suffering, and I was trying to understand that concept of fixation in terms of what is this thing, what is fixation supposed to be doing for us? What is the benefit that it’s supposed to bring so like what is the thing that we lose out by stopping this fixation thing now it might be the case that in the modern world you don’t lose it out on anything that’s like meaningful, but I think if you take anything to say that like OK, you can just this this thing that your mind body kind of does either naturally or by no conditioning in the civilized world there’s like there’s some Chester fence argument here where it’s like maybe there’s benefits here that you’re not seeing and so if we just say that like OK, let’s just get rid of it because it seems like there’s only benefits from doing so I think it’s right to ask the question of like, what was it therefore, what was it doing and I think I think I think Kevin thought that this was like a big impediment to my practice or something like I’m about to like jump off the train. I’m trying understand all of you know the concept of meditation before all kind of like do any practice and there’s like I think there’s a piece of truth in that but at the same time like I just find it useful to understand these things and I I don’t I can make, only so much I need to have some explanation of what I’m doing and why and I do understand the viewpoint of somebody saying that like they kind of like no better than me and kind of just like shake me out of it and say like no just like I know better than you like stop getting in your own way just like stop doing it and I think my feeling of this is just like that is not what I need. It’s not it doesn’t work for me and I think you see as like over, intellectual electricity over intellectualization is just me trying to make sense of things, and I can’t really don’t want to operate in the world without attempting to make sense of them and, the thing that I need for my teacher is if you know that this whole thing that I’m doing is, it isn’t some sense of waste of time I need you to talk to me in my own terms which that’s the only way that you’ll be able to guide me towards the place that you think I should be going And I suspect that no matter where we land someone who wants to navigate the world through understanding it and gonna be, I’m open to taking some lead to faith but only be so large and I I do need to kind of like ground decision making in coherent conception of the world, and if my teacher can’tadopt that and guide me from within that then I don’t think I don’t think it’s gonna work
