> Another week of no twitter on phone (from prev weekly intentions)
Do I really wanna be doing this? What was the purpose?
I used it as a distraction. Like when I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed,
I'll check my phone.
With that habit in place, between working a lot and using my phone to distract
me when I'm not, I'm never thinking or doing anything non-work related.
The root problem feels like the overwork and stress but by removing twitter I remove the self-medication and the problem becomes more apparent and more in need of a solution.
