Think of it like a finder app
you have a main view where you see a list of your things
maybe you have some places favorited in the sidebar

logging, todos, notes
logging is important to have early cause I want to be doing that during my month break 
maybe have it be CRM'y for reminding me to reach out to people

not sure how the ai-first bit plays in yet
maybe there's a cli view? or maybe it just is a chat and that's fine. or if it is a cli, I guess by default clis execute what you write by default, so makes sense an llm would execute what you write. could have a command to make a note if that's what you want to be doing.


I like the idea of either:
- making a tracer-bullet version which is deployable as soon as possible, so can iterate on in prod
- deciding on the product/interface questions I have, and prototype those first 

For every feature, should ask: what's the llm-first version of this? 
Whenever I start thinking about a UI to do something, ask: Can an llm do this? 
Like probably you do end up wanting a UI for crud too, but maybe that's actually secondary.
The primary interface is through an LLM. Just like coding is becoming.

So yeah maybe flat list of filterable *non-editable* items.
The only way of editing anything is through an LLM chat interface. 

^ I wonder if this requires some research into how people do it. Maybe LLMs just know already?
