# see hear feel vs breath counting

see hear feel is a noting practice
noting practice isn't exclusive to UM
fairly new though, like 1950s
idea is that momentary concentration is still concentration. it's kinda less grippy too. Maybe easier to work on too.

sustained concentration practice vs insight practice

In these practices, you're trying to be in a non-doing state. Things happen but if you "notice an intention for your attention, drop that intention". Just let things do their thing.

I felt a connection to the doing-ness of conversation I often feel and feel I need. Otherwise there's dead air. But also when I have a couple drinks that need seems to drop away.

non-grippiness is where we're aiming
can have radical non-interference while still directing attention

maybe start spacing out the practices?
