Want to have a better habit of tracking and remember my little piques of interest, sparks of joy, etc. 
Like it feels like my decision making is largely driven by todo lists and projects, by the part of myself that thinks in "shoulds".
But I'm thinking it should (lol) be just as important (more?) to be driven by wants, likes, interests, etc.
