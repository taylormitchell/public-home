I've got a whole hour! What to do! 
Would be nice if I was super energized about it. Feeling low energy though.
Didn't sleep great. Did a workout too.
Is there something fun I could do? Without being mindless?

I could meditate. That's mindFULL. Ok that's an option - leaving for now

Maybe play with my little todo app on top of markdown notes? The gui sounds kinda fun.

Maybe put my notes on a little server in the cloud which I can ssh to? Maybe build an run my app there too.
I could try using pulumi to provision it too.
