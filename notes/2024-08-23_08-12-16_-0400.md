I'm imagining an evoluation of [my notes](./digital-home.md) where my code and notes intermix more than they do now.
The whole repo is like a filesystem. Code and notes are segregated from each other.
Code packages need to dictate some structure, but the nodes can be anywhere. 
Imagine dropping markdown files at random points in a package, or even adding and parsing todos from code files themselves.
