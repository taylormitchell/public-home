My project ideas are often centered around personal use. That’s ok but less useful to others (and less useful as a portfolio project)

I wonder if this is related to collapsed awareness. Like if you’re stuck in your own head and your own problems, you only have inward facing ideas. Once you open up, and have a deep okayness with your life, then your mind is open to explore outward facing ideas.
