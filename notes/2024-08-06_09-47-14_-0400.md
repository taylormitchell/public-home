When to use [one file vs many](./one-file-vs-many.md)?
Some reasons I gravitate towards many but maybe don't need to:
- I can link to individual thoughts/ideas. But I can do that with headings within markdown files
- I can trigger events in response to new files. Yes but also if I'm tracking things with git, I can use file changes to trigger reactions to e.g. if I wanted an LLM to read my new files and do stuff with them, it could do that with file changes too.
