Diagnosing should pain after [[gymnastics]]

Current explanation: 
- stress from particular motions and/or repetition causes swelling
- swelling reduces space in the shoulder joint
- reduced space causes pinching of the muscle (tendon?) which is the acute pain I feel


Current interventions to avoid injury and pain: 
- Warm up with bungee exercises. I'll be doing light rotator cuff exercises to warm up those muscles plus some light resistive movements through the full range of motion.
- Static shoulder stretch. To prepare for dynamic movements that put my shoulder into extreme ranges of motion, I'll first stretch statically so there's less resistance at those extremes.
- At the end of training, doing some kind of relevant strengthening exercise for the should (tbd) 

Strengthening exercises
- Supraspinatus
	- Straight arm lifts with light dumbbells 
	- Lying on stomach. Arms 90deg bend. Rotate upwards
	- Lying on stomach. Arms straight. Rotate upwards
- Infraspinatus and Teres Minor
	- External Rotation with Resistance Band
- Subscapularis
	- Internal Rotation with Resistance Band

Warm up exercises
Same as strengthening but do them all with lighter band. No need for multiple sets or to count repetitions. Just get the muscles warm.
