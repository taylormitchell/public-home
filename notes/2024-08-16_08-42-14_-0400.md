Felt very skillfull in the beginning of this sessions
Many fantasies w/ image/thought were going, and I felt like I was able to allow them to come and go without getting captured by them either.
In the past, I'd either get lost in them or need to kinda push them away. There were a few moments there where I found a 3rd option and they continued without grabbing me.
Cool!
