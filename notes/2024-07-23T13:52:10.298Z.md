Feeling less interestinged in note-taking tools right now. What's wrong with just taking little text notes like this? Seems like the 80/20 for me. I *could* help others by building tools that implement workflows that I can do with my programmer tools but others can't. But is that really worthwhile? Do people really care that much? Why don't I just contribute to people's lives in ways that are more meaningful to them and scales to more people?
