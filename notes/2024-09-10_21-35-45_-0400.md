Suffering according to Shinzen Young's

Suffering equation:
```
suffering = discomfort x resistance
```

"It is not a good thing to fixate the self" - Sasaki Roshi

In a [discussion on fixation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=623s&ab_channel=ShinzenVideos) Shinzen Young suggests that fixation is a necessary cause of suffering, and that perhaps it's an objective measurable physiological phenomenon. He analogizes it to flowing water which can become turbulent when it surpasses a certain reynolds number. Perhaps the flowing of the mind is also like this, and fixation like the reynolds number which determines whether the flow will become turbulent (and thus suffering) or not.

Q: Does this suggest that fixation should be minimized to zero? How would that affect one's ability to navigate the world?
