- Finished relations to relations ui.
  - Decided to reel in the scope and just render the relation as plaintext for now. Reconciling differences between our dropdowns felt too heavy of a lift for me. That works is now on `taylor/reconcile-dropdowns`
- Implemented new business rule for showing a node as a reference

  - ```ts
    // typical case: you add the first labelled child
    // if (labelledRelationsFromThis > 0) {
    //   return "global";
    // }
    // // typical case: after creating a node next to a labelled relation, you add children to it
    // if (lablledRelationsToThis > 0 && relationsFromThis > 0) {
    //   return "global";
    // }

    const relations = relationsFromThis + relationsToThis;
    const labelledRelations = labelledRelationsFromThis + lablledRelationsToThis;

    // if (relations > 0) {
    //   return "global";
    // }
    // everything rendered on screen would be global

    // if (relations > 1) {
    //   return "global";
    // }
    // any time you add a child to a node, it becomes global

    // if (labelledRelations > 0) {
    //   return "global";
    // }
    // if you add a labelled relation child, that blank child is now considered "global"
    // and rendered as a reference.

    // if (labelledRelations > 1) {
    //   return "global";
    // }
    // I've got a node. I add a labelled relation child. It's still local. Then I add another
    // and it becomes global. Feels arbitrary.

    if (relationsToThis > 1) {
      return "global";
    }
    // maybe you want something to be node-y before?

    return "local";
    ```

- Sprint planning
- Triaging work with Piyush
- Troubleshooting bug where relation would disappear when you swift it from a backlink to forward link
  the bug:
  whenever we switch from Relation(id: r0, from: b, to: a) to Relation(id: r0, from: a, to: b). the a node no longer has the r0 relation in it’s list
  the issue:
  in setFrom, we delete r0 from the relation list of b and add it to a (it’s actually already there, so this is a no-op)
  in setTo, we delete r0 from the relation list of a and add it to b. ← this is where we lose r0 in the relation list for a
- PR to improve perf of autocomplete plugin
