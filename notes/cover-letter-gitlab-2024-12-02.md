Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express interest in the Intermediate Fullstack Engineer position on GitLab's Fulfillment: Utilization team. GitLab's mission to enable everyone to contribute resonates with me, as I've focused my career on building tools that empower people to collaborate in new ways. At Ideaflow, I worked on tools for thought and knowledge sharing - work that aligns closely with my passion for building collaborative software.

At Ideaflow, I led the development of full-stack systems using Typescript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. My experience building a document editor with sync and optimistic updates demonstrates my ability to build complex customer-facing interfaces. I managed a team of 3 engineers, running technical interviews and code reviews while mentoring team members through detailed PR feedback and documentation. I also implemented comprehensive engineering best practices including automated testing, PR checklists, and AWS monitoring – practices that would transfer well to GitLab's emphasis on quality and thorough iterative solutions.

As an IBM consultant, I regularly translated complex technical requirements into clear proposals and documentation for stakeholders, iteratively refining solutions based on client feedback. I designed and implemented REST APIs while working closely with frontend teams and product owners to define clear interfaces – demonstrating the kind of cross-stack collaboration needed for GitLab's usage tracking and management solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to GitLab's mission and helping build solutions that provide predictability and transparency to your customers.

Best regards,
Taylor Mitchell
