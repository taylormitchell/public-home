# Meditation 
This note represents my intention to have meditation be an area of my life I work at. 

I don't have any todos associated with it at the moment. Just some ongoing practices:
- Weekly meditation sessions with kevin
- 10min meditation daily. Usually breath see-hear-feel or counting. 
- 1 hour meditation once per week.

## My practice
- Spend time with rest. Make it a natural part of practice (see notes from 2024-09-03)
- Do do-nothing practice
- Do a 10min meditation during lunch breaks
- Do microhits throughtout the work day 
- 1 hour meditation once per week.

## Long sits
- I start to get scattered and fidgety as sits get longer. Take this as a practice opportunity. One thing you're learning to do through meditation is put awareness between stimulus and response. This gives room to be intentional about your actions. Use this fidgetiness to practice that.

## Things to play with
- see-hear-feel practice
- meditating on thoughts [](./meditation-sessions-with-kevin-2024-10-30.md)
