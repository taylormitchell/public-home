Maybe spend a week learning Ruby. Do a little project. 
- Probably the feed from my notes. 
- But maybe something that would actually be useful for others.
- Maybe just redo the logging app in Ruby. It's an easy one to start with. I could do another later if needed.
- Start with a relational database and then move it to git-backed later once I know the traditional way of doing things.
