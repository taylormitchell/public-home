Thinking about trying to have a good time in the morning.
Kinda aligned with [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md).
Don't use the morning to get the personal work done that needs to get done. (do later)
Use the morning to practice a state of being where you're relaxed, uncontrained, following your curiosity, and having fun.
Some reasons to do this in the morning:
- mornings feel like such a struggle. maybe easier if I'm not forcing myself to do things
- I tend to use mornings to try to get "the most important things done". I think cultivating a state of being described above is very much aligned with my current goals. Like getting a new job is an intrumental goal towards being relaxed and happy. Why not focus on the state directly?
