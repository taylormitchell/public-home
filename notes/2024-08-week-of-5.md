[^1]: I was reflecting this morning on how I'm overwhelmed with work and self-medicating with distractions. I'd like to start moving myself back into a state where I'm less overwhelmed, more energetic, and find space for non-work things. But rather than wait to solve the overwhelm, I think it's good to remove the distractions now, which will make me more aware of the ways in which I'm getting overwhelmed by work. A useful meditation practice too.
