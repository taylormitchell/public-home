commit with old plugin

I don't wanna use LexicalTypeaheadMenuPlugin for the search-or-replace dropdown cause I don't wanna have to reach inside it to change the highlight index logic.

## reasons to not use LexicalTypeaheadMenuPlugin

I've got a version which kinda works but I need to shoe-horn in some state to track whether the text has changed since the last focus. 

This gets around the fact that the handler passed to the LexicalTypeaheadMenuPlugin runs whenver the editor is updated (including selection) not just the text.

This is on top of the weirdness of having a separate listener to set the dropdown to null when the text is empty.

At this point, it feels like I'm trying to put a square peg in a round hole. Better to drop Lexical's plugin and do it ourself?

ended up sticking with it for now. lexical typeahead menu plugin does a lot which I don't want to reimplement.

and it wasn't that hard to make it so the search-or-replace doesn't update til after the first keystroke.

I think it makes sense to define and register as much of the core state transition functions at the top level component. The only reason we *don't* do that for one of them is because we don't have control over the LexicalTypeaheadMenuPlugin.
