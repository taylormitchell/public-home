There's an gestalt that comes to mind now and then like "maybe I should just do X and make a lot of money".
It mostly starts there.
I think it's coming from a place of want for freedom.
Like why don't I just work hard now, be rich, and then I'm free to do whatever I want.
There's some truth in this, but I wonder how true it really is. I can easily imagine myself still having existential worries in that world. Or having trouble motivating myself and not knowing what to do about it.
Like upon reflection, I tend to prefer the paths where I have a more balanced life, which leaves space for me to see and improve my problems today.
I like the [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md) path. If it's true, it's great. Cause the first step is making your life better today. No delayed gratification needed. But it also promises greatness later.
