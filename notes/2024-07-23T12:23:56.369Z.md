At this point, we need to earn the time and space to play around and explore. We need to build something people want, and do so quickly, so we can raise funding or build revenue to keep us afloat. That means that in the short term, we do less exploring of interface ideas and "let's just try it" decision making. That's not to say there isn't value in that. There is! But we need *some* demonstration of values to others in the short term before we do that.

Relatedly: we shouldn't get too hung up on particular interface ideas of ux decisions. The thing that's core is a graph which is editable and explorable. We need a small number of interfaces right now. We don't need fancy features. Many clicks is fine for now.
