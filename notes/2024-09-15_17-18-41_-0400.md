# Five ways to know yourself

Mindful awareness is defined as "three attentional skills working together: concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity."

## Do nothing

>  So, when you Do Nothing, you may have a lot of sensory activity and you may go unconscious and get caught up in things quite a bit. That’s okay! Whenever you notice an intention to do anything about all of that, drop that intention.

> We’re going to define intention within this context to mean something that is totally voluntary. If you cannot drop it for even a moment, then, by our definition, it is not really part of your free will. It’s happening to you and you don’t need to drop it.
