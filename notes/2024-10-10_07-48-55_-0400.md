Feeling a little bit stuck in a rut in my thinking.
Or maybe that's not it. Maybe it's just not flowy this morning. Like I wake up and can do anything. and nothing is really coming to mind.
I did a little of this and that, but I don't feel a fire or momentum behind anything.
Maybe it's just that I *don't* have momentum on anything?
