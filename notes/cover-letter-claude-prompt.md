Write a cover letter based on the provided resume and job posting, following these principles:

CORE APPROACH

Write as if explaining to a friend why you're perfect for this specific role
Every sentence should either advance your story or directly connect to a job requirement
No generic statements - if it could apply to any job seeker, remove it

CONTENT STRUCTURE

Opening (2-3 sentences):

Brief connection to company's specific mission
One clear sentence stating the role you're applying for

Body (2 paragraphs):

Focus on your 2 most relevant roles/experiences
For each experience, describe:

One significant project/achievement that directly maps to job requirements
The technical skills used (drawing from posting's tech stack)
Your impact on team/business outcomes

Closing (1-2 sentences):

Brief reinforcement of mission alignment
Clean, simple closing without overenthusiastic language

WRITING STYLE

Crisp, direct sentences
Active voice
Use numbers and specifics (e.g., "10x improvement" not "significant improvement")
Mirror the job posting's technical terminology, but don't overuse it
Avoid emphatic langugage that rings hollow (to me) like "express my *strong* interest" and "resonates strongly with me"

CRITICAL CHECKS

Could this letter only be written by you for this specific role?
Is every achievement backed by resume evidence?
Does each paragraph advance your story?
Remove any sentence that feels like filler

LENGTH

Aim for 250-300 words
4 paragraphs maximum
