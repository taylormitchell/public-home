what's up bro?

things are going ok at work. we got a working app. things aren't too crazy.
A while ago I resolved to be less career focused. I'm still trying to do a "good" job, but within tighter bounds of time and energy. I think I've been doing a better job of that in the last few weeks.

I was chatting with Emily yesterday, explaining how I didn't feel like I was finding time and energy for stuff outside of work. This includes personal responsibilities, todos, etc as well as side projects, or playing around. I'd like to find more space for that.

I've been getting back on top of a routine this week which I think is good. I think a certain amount of structure is good. Getting up and doing my meditation and flashcards seem good. Now and then I waffle on the flashcard practice, but I think it really is worthwhile for me. Even if just for remembering details from my personal life e.g. what's going on with Ray. It feels good to know those things. It keeps me connected. It also makes it less likely I'll end up in uncomfortable situations.

These little text notes have been fun. It's so much easier to create little scripts to automate things here compared to a whole javascript app. No need to do deployments or anything. I like it.
