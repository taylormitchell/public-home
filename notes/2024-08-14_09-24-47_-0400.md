If you set expectations or standards for yourself which are too high for you to attain naturally, then part of you needs to apply pressure to make it happen. If it’s true that applying pressure like this causes suffering, and there’s a way to make progress without it, then this is a mistake. 

An example for thinking about this: part of me feels I should be working during work hours. I should be locked in. But then today I get a bunch of birthday messages, and both feel compelled to respond but also feel I should do it later while I work. Why put myself in that situation! Either put on dnd so you can stay locked in without temptation, or leave it off and be ok with being distracted and following your desires. 

There’s an interpretation of this I don’t like and a failure mode that needs to be avoided. Like you could satisfy this by just doing nothing and all day, which would lead to suffering too. 

I wonder if you naturally get out of this though? Like that’d be a state you don’t like, so you’d naturally be motivated to get out?

I bet non-doing people would say this but I dunno I think there are states you can get into where you lose that capacity. Like addictive/passive modes which are local maxima. You gotta craft your environments and habits to avoid these
