Pickle fest is on Sat Oct 5th. Not sure if ring will be ready. But she'd be out of the house for a bit. I could also rope in Cass to help.

- flower petals (see "WAKISAKI Artificial Silk Rose Petals")
- flowers
- go pro to capture the moment (or something)

She mentioned the other day liking that spot where we had champers looking at the lake (and the bird "attacked" her) 
Harder to set up something to capture the moment though (I'd need someone there to record it)


I need an excuse to do a date night on the roof top. Maybe I'll lie and say that someone is coming over? We're going to do burgers on the roof or something. 
Maybe I *also* need to get rid of here for the day? So I have time to set up?
Maybe I need to have it be one of her friends? I could use Meredith perhaps?




### Blakes proposal 2024-09-08
Sharon wanted to do dinner and karaoke with friends. So blake planned around that. He did the proposal at home in their apartment, had his friend ready to take photos in the park nearby, and then invited some extra friends to join them for dinner and karaoke.

- Candle lit something on the balcony or patio (private plus could hook something up to capture the moment). Could be cold out though. But could do it inside upstairs too.
- I don’t think she wants it in a public place
- Could go to someone’s place? Then they “leave” but really they’re close by to take photos
- Do it in the apartment and have photographer hiding somewhere
- Something about photos?

- Things she likes: cats, hockey, food, pickles, books, naps, survivor  
- Our first in-person date was a walk along the lakeshore. Do it there? 
- candles
- love languages: acts of service, words of affirmation, physical touch, gifts
- favourite movie: little miss sunshine

- Inside jokes
  - you are soooo good looking

if outside: have blankets

See chats with claude today

- Write a book about us. Maybe it leads up to the proposal? Something nice with a good binding, images, etc

If I had to choose right now, I think I'd do something on the rooftop. I can imagine how I'd decorate it all nice and romantic. It'll be intimate. I could maybe sneak in a photographer. I could probably get a recording of the moment. I could have dinner ready up there or we could just do it low-key together here.
