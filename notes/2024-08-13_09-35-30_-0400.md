I've said [elsewhere](./2024-07-23.md) that ways-of-being like [](./relax-happy-achieve.md) entail being "less sucessful" or "less good" in the short term.

A related but diff framing: If you're trying to live in a more non-doing and flowy way, you'll also be less effective in the short-term. I kinda do think you can be more effective this way later, but you need to drop some existing patterns that are currently proping up effectiveness to get there.

This came to mind as I was thinking about writing some reflections post-meditation. Part of me is like "well it's already 9:30am, so you gotta get straight to working" and then thinks about all the things I "need" to get done today. How could I justify doing anything else? Then there's another part of me that thinks reflections like these are really important, and you need to do them when the opportunity arises. What I'm gesturing at here isn't even a meditation thing. David Deutsche may say something like "Creativity is inherintly unpredictable. We can't plan in advance our creative thoughts.". So there's a way of being that needs to relax contraints to allow for creativity and opportunity. You can restrict yourself too much in a way that boost short-term effectiveness but reduces it long term.
