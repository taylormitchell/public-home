working out my final payment schedule at ideaflow:

- auto paymenment nov 8: 6,473.01 CAD - Memo: Payment for 2 Weeks

See email "Invoice INV0031 for October 13th to November 3rd 2023" for discussion of this. 
Jacob mentions setting up autopayments and that the first payment + an adhoc one would cover the oct 9 - nov 3 period.

So the auto-payment was received on the Wednesday following the week it was covering.

That's the last invoice for regular work I submitted.
