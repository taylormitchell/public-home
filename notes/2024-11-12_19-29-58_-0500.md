wish I had stronger long term convictions
like with switching into ml/ai. I contracted for a bit then was at ibm for a bit. Feels like if I'd been smarter at steering + pushed towards the goal harder, I could have gotten a lot further.
given where ai is now, maybe that could've been good.
I'm really not sure if that's what I want to be doing though. Probably why I didn't push so hard or stick with it.
there is something there about being deliberate about what you want to do and pursuing it with vigor.
i often feel both a little lost, a little overwhelmed, and a little tired. 
makes it hard to know what to do. easier to appease my work-self by just doing my current job well.
