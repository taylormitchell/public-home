Maybe have a second level extension for the list/markdown format. So something like ideas.list.md. That way tools can read and write to it like a markdown, but tools that know itâ€™s used for a list use case get the hint. Not sure how needed this really is tbh. Maybe useful for me to remember though? I could always use a separate list to index those though. Less readily available though
