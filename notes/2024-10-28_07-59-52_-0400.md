probably should do weekly planning first, and make note of any wants as you're doing that. once finished, you can decide to pursue those wants (e.g. like the updating of my note-cli template enginee just now)


wondering if there's a roam-style zoom in/out that you could create for markdown notes using headings.

MAYBE when you create a week page, you also add an entry to a "daily notes" page with a link there.
