Notes from looking for a new app to replace mint to do this, but I couldn't find one that would connect to all my instituitions

## Options

- 
Monarch
$8 USD
- Monarch lacks support for several of the Canadian financial institutions I use https://www.reddit.com/r/mintuit/comments/1b5pjtk/mint_alternatives_for_canada/


https://www.piere.com/
- $10 USD
- Piere has great connectivity to Canadian accounts if that is what you're looking for https://www.reddit.com/r/mintuit/comments/1b5pjtk/mint_alternatives_for_canada/


YNAB
$15 USD


Nothing comes close to as good as Mint was. I tried all options out there and concluded that Monarch Money and Lunch Money are the best alternatives at this time if you need support for both US and Canadian accounts. https://www.reddit.com/r/mintuit/comments/1b5pjtk/mint_alternatives_for_canada/
