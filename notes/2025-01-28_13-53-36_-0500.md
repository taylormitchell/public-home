# Coffee chat with Zach Mathew

Zach's a manager at shop. He's been at shopify for 4 years.

Team I'll be joining:
- There's an umbrella brand called shop. Includes shop app and shop pay.
- I'm joining the shop pay installments team.
- There's about ~15 people on the team.
- A big initiative in shop is adding commerce identity.

How to succeed:
- ship quickly
- but you'll need to get lots of context so hard to shop right away
- mastery=impact+craft
- salary goes up as mastery goes up, or when you moves roles
