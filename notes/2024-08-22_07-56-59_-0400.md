In the morning, I don’t wanna get up. So I laze around, taking my time. Maybe I put in a podcast. I still don’t wanna start anything so I sit and listen to it for a bit. Finally I get around to doing something with my morning, and just as I’m getting started I see how little time I have left and become aware of what I wanted to do. This stresses me out a bit. Such a common pattern for me. Wish I could break it
