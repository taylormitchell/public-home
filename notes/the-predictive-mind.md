# The Predictive Mind

My summary of the whole “perception requires constraints” claim is “it’s not magic”

We get sensory data through our sense organs. The mind's world model generates a multimedia 3d simulation of the world which fits the sense data. This is provided as input to the (metacognition? attention head? higher self?) which can attend to different parts, generate inferences about the simulation itself, which can have downward causation back to the mode.




Our emotions are caused by our bodily arousal, not vice-versa.
> A famous theory of emotion originates in William James and Carl Lange, according to whom feeling states arise as responses to states of bodily arousal including rise in heart rate, perspiration, and so on. On this account we “feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble” so that it is “not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be” (James 1890: Vol. 2, pp. 449–50).


Our emotions are functions (in part) of our physiological arousal. This is the opposite of common sense view: that we perceive the world, feel an emotion, and the body reflects that emotion. This view originated(?) from the [James–Lange theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%E2%80%93Lange_theory) which claimed there that emotions are solely a function of bodily arousal. Today, it's more widely believed that arousal is one of several causes of emotion.



> These signals are **prediction errors** because they might not match the brain's current predictions about the body's state.

But only if the brain *doesn't* predict that state, correct?

There's some arousal we didn't expect. The emotion that arises is our phenomenological experience of the explanation of the arousal which our mind generated. For example, our hear is racing and then our mind predicts there's danger, which is experienced as an emotion of fear.  


Q: Under the predictive coding theory, is the phenomenological experience of bodily sensation the raw sensory input or the prediction of the sensory input? (short answer)
A: Under predictive coding theory, the phenomenological experience of bodily sensation is primarily based on the brain's **predictions of sensory input**, rather than the raw sensory input itself.

## Glossary
Interoceptive Signals: These are internal bodily sensations, such as heart rate, arousal, and other physiological states.
