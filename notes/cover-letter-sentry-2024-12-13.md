Dear Hiring Manager,

As a developer who has experienced firsthand how poor monitoring can derail product development, I'm excited to join Sentry's mission to help developers write better software faster through the Senior Software Engineer position on the Crons & Uptime team.

At Ideaflow, I partnered with our CEO and design lead to shape our document editor from initial concept through successful Product Hunt launch, balancing user experience needs with technical constraints. Working in close collaboration, we rapidly iterated on prototypes while I led the implementation of the full-stack applications in React/TypeScript, including a real-time sync engine. This hands-on experience in both product design and technical architecture in a distributed team environment, coupled with the success of our launch as the day's highest-voted product, demonstrates my ability to deliver polished, user-focused features from conception to completion.

At IBM Consulting, I designed and implemented the REST API for crisis evacuation system that has helped thousands of families. I also optimized large-scale ETL pipelines in Python, often achieving 10x throughput improvements on legacy systems through careful performance profiling and system architecture decisions.

Sentry's focus on building thoughtful, holistic user experiences while tackling complex technical challenges is exactly the kind of work I want to pursue. I look forward to discussing how my experience in full-stack development and product innovation could contribute to Sentry's mission.
