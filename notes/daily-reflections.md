# Daily Reflections


## 2024-10-15
Kinda cool having all my files searchable within this workspace.  
Feeling good about re-committing to consistent meditation practice. Kevin's suggestion to do more microhits throughout the day is a good one. 
Work was fine. Just going with the flow.

## 2024-09-30
Felt tired and needed to drag myself out of bed. Listened to podcast while drinking coffee. Didn't do anki or meditate. Eventually got to doing some weekly planning. Once I did, I wished I had more time.
Tried to relax after the morning routine + dentist. Felt good. Need to try to keep this state of mind going: [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md) 
Work wasn't too bad. I just gotta stop trying to make the company work in a sensical way. Just do what's needed and keep moving. Voice my opinion but don't fight. Don't let things get me worked up. 

## 2024-09-26
Feeling pretty good today in general. 
I've falled off the wagon a bit with my morning routines and twitter stuff. There's some part of me that was relieved when I didn't hold myself to that standard for the day. Not needing to meditate first thing was nice. Just jumping into whatever I felt like doing was nice. I don't wanna drop these habits completely though. But there is some wisdom in the fact that I'm fighting against these habits.

Was feeling pretty scattered this morning. Couldn't get into a good headspace for planning the week.
Had a good meditation session with Kevin. Did the 6 nails. I felt quite a bit more equinimity after that. It seemed to continue through the day too (although maybe it was just the lack of stressors)
Work was chill. Mood on the team was pretty good. RPC's is kinda upset about things at Ideaflow generally, and "throwing him under the bus" re engineering productivity. I dunno if I buy that tbh. I think he's reading into things too much. 
The idea of making little improvements to my logging app to help with [happy gut](./area-health.md#happy-gut) sparked joy.
Hopeful I can get a good plan for the week and make meaningful progress on a few things.

Good meditation discussion with Kevin today.
Felt pretty busy today but not overwhelmed like previous days this week.
Felt engaging hearing feedback from a user session today. Makes me want to want to work on product here. But obv upon reflection I don't wanna do that with Jacob. 
Time to workout and eat and then free time??

## 2024-09-16
I was really having trouble meditating this morning. Felt very agitated generally.
Once the day started, things got worse. I felt overwhelmed by work. Also demotivated.
At some point I just sat and let my mind run. Jotting down thoughts as they came. This calmed me down and I got some clarity.
Also later neither rpc or jacob were on edge which could've made things worse but didn't.
I'm ending the day feeling a bit agitated again. This is common for me. And it *sucks* cause it means I've lost the energy to do the things which will get me out of this job trap. Blah!
I did have a nice walk to the dry cleaners in the middle of the day though. 
Maybe I should do these reflections at different parts of the day sometimes? I always do it right after work and it's kinda depressing to read them all here.

## 2024-09-13
Felt flustered today. RPC came back and was generally unhappy with things. I took it personally.
Product meeting was kind of shitty. None of the use cases I tried were that great.
I feel compelled to work cause I don't like where we're at and want to get ahead of it. At the same time, we're *always* behind. It's exhausting. 

## 2024-09-12
Kinda cool when mew is working 
Meetings with jacob are frustrating. He's just so slow to pick things up, chaotic in his thinking, and isn't good at holding context. It puts a huge burden on me to keep the conversations going in a useful direction. It's just below the level of effectiveness that I'm willing to tolerate.

## 2024-09-11
Personal work this morning was productive! 
Felt a bit overwhelmed by work today. Getting pulled in too many directions. Felt a little optimistic after suggesting we mob the loading bug and saw some energy around it. But I'm less confident as time is passing that it's gonna go anywhere.
Design meeting on bundles with Jacob was as you'd expect. Lot's of thinking that's fuzzy and/or going in circles. I'm gonna have to do the work of synthesizing / making sense of it. The meetings in general are frustrating.
Still hitting bugs in the app while using e.g. while using it during meetings. Not _that_ many but enough where it's blocking my usage (e.g. autocomplete not pulling up the object I want).

Pretty good day.
Meditation session with Kevin was interesting. Felt a little weird about it. I think he just didn't know how to interpret my vibe. It wasn't clear what I was putting out either though. I feel like there *is* a point in what I was saying though. I'm still not sure how to express it.
Finished work on time.
Had a chat with Ray.

Glad Jacob's not flipping out. It makes my life easier this week. 

I don't trust many people on the team to make substantial progress. Like I just gotta give Eden busy work kinda. It takes me longer to review and fix then it would to do myself. This makes sense at a big company where you can invest in building people up but I don't think it makes sense here.

Finishing work at a reasonable time. Good job!

Felt pretty blah this morning. Still managed to get up and do my anki and meditation though. I do wish it was easier though. I kinda feel unsure / lost about what to do all the time.

Good meditation session this morning. Interesting in exploring the auto-pilot quadrant of meditation. 
Lots of meetings. The meetings with Evan and Ridhi were a little charged. It's too often this happens. There's just a general "everything not working" that keeps coming up everywhere. It's not fun dealing with it.
Feeling tired now. This is the type of thing that zaps my energy and makes me just wanna relax later, which takes away from my wants to do other things after work.
Feel pretty good about resolution to leave ideaflow. I want to make some progress on next steps and communicate with jacob soon-ish.

Feeling a bit tired out right now. Also a little anxious. Like I said I'd work out but I also wanna wrap up day, reflect, I also needa put that eye patch on, I end too late, etc, etc.   
Too many expectations on myself? Or just need better systems to meet them? Related to: [](./2024-08-14_09-24-47_-0400.md)
Coding all day is hard! Making things that are good and don't break is taxing on me brain. Feeling good about where I got to with the ts work though.

## 2024-08-17
I was pretty tired and sluggish in the morning though. Took a while to get going. Eventually I got into a groove looking at a few jobs and taking notes. I was a little anxious about the whole thing though.
Feeling pretty good right now. Finished work right on time.
No major fires at work either. Just getting some stuff done and feeling productive.
Looking forward to the weekend!

Got worked up at work today. Just lots of little things. No fires. Something about lots of meaningless work I guess.
Meditated in the morning was good though. Got some microhits in. 
Did some work in the morning too. Not bad.

## 2024-10-28
Felt busy and rushed in the morning.
Lots of meetings in the afternoon. Need to guard my time better.
Problems flow up to me. I'm both too checked out to deal with them in earnest, but also feel responsible for them. Not a good combo.
Finishing work on time which is nice :)
Feeling pretty zapped though. I see why I default to relaxing after work. It's a nice escape.

## 2024-10-31
Do I care about these? I never go back to them.
