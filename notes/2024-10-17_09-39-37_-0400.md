Sorting is required. See discussion and uncertainty re spec. What else?

Should do a check in with Jacob on whether Mew 0.1 is done. (see above)

There’s still work left to do for sorting PR.

Maybe go through mew feedback

I can’t be doing important dev and being on top of mew feedback and thoughtstream. It’s too much. Jacob will *say* it’s ok to eg ignore mew feedback and thoughtstream but then reveal through his words later there’s an expectation people are working on these things. He *wants* people working on these things *and* the important things are getting done. He’s not resolving these conflicts in his own head.
