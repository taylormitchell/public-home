Something that makes the logseq data less interoperable is that a lot of the information / relationships is inside the markdown files themselves. So you gotta read and parse everything to e.g. get all data with some tag. As opposed to if you did tagging by symlinking files with a directory or having a file thats a list and you add things too.
