Each layer outputs 2 things:
- An inference
- A prediction about the layer below's inference 

The N+1 layer's prediction of the Nth layer's inference is compared to the actual inference from the Nth layer to produce a prediction error value. The N+1 layer receives this error signal back (what does it do with it?)

How are the Nth weights updated? Is it just a function of it's prediction of the N-1 layer's inference? Or is it also updated based on the diff between it's own inference and the N+1 layer's prediction?


Example:
- Layer 2's inference is that there's is a cat
- Layer 1's inference is that there are ears
- Layer 2 predicts that Layer 1 will/won't infer there are ears
