# Proposal speak

- I love the relationship we've built based on joy, support, and honesty.
- Admire how you are with friends/family. And yourself.
- You balance me. I've grown to feel more authentically myself with you.
- I also appreciate how you listen when I ramble on about space or meditation
- I want to continue building a life with you forever. 

Emily, will you marry me?
