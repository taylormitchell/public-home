When my mind drifts to "finding the perfect job", I start to get overwhelmed.
I don't think it's even a useful framing or goal for me right now.
If the goal is more [relax-happy-achieve](./relax-happy-achieve.md), and the relax part is centered around meditation and work-life balance, then having the "perfect" or "meaningful" job isn't that important for achieving my current aims. 
A job at a good company shipping stuff is fine.
