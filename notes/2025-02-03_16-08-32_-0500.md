Items
Notes/todos
People and life updates about them

Everything should be scheduleable. Many things will be scheduled and then rescheduled using exponential backoff. This a core workflow for bringing items to my attention

Integrations
- contacts
- flashcards
- git repo

AI first

Store relationships between items

For example, flashcards generated through the app get persisted to anki. But the source gets stored as a relationship in the graph. When the source item(s) updates, a suggested update to the flashcard can be produced

When data is added to the system, ai will suggest create/update operations. This may be shown to user inline or in a queue (eg in response to periodic sync jobs) (maybe this leverage the same scheduling system?)

Imagine you keep a family tree in the system. How to create that?
Filter for relationships which are of type “family tree” (or whatever). Then explore by expanding out nodes to see parents, children, etc
The filter is important cause otherwise you’d see lots of relations around a person which aren’t family tree related. 

Maybe AI can schedule todos for itself too?
