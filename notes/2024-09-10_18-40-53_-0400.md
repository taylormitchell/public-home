There’s a claim in meditation that our reaction / contraction around experience is the root of suffering 
what’s the exact claim?
Then there’s an additional claim that it’s also getting in the way of skillful action in the world. If you just train your mind to stop doing this contracty thing, you both get rid of suffering AND become more effective. 
It’s a pretty extraordinary combined claim.
