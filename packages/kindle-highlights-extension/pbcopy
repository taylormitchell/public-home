-notes, 
+notes - flat directory of text files, with a prefix timestamp for sorting
+
+(Maybe notes should be at the root directory? That way links are always absolute?)
+
+data - used by personal apps for persistence
+
+files - large files of any type. Not version controlled
+
+packages - distinct code packages, organized with subfolders
+
+scripts - one-off scripts
+
+Files are organized into top-level directories based on practical considerations around file systems, version control, code tools, etc. 
+
+For example, it‚Äôs often nice to have notes ordered by creation date. But because we use version control, we can‚Äôt trust the creation date on the file itself. So we put a prefix on the date which allows reverse chronological sorting.
+
+Data files could go here too, but in these cases the sorting isn‚Äôt as important, so no need to shoehorn it in when you don‚Äôt want to
+
+The ‚Äúfiles‚Äù directory is for large things like images and videos which are unreasonable to version control. Probably a symlink to Dropbox. 
+
+You *could* put files and data together, but often my data is small enough that it can be version controlled by git. Splitting by directory is an easy way to tell give what to version control and what not too. 
+
+The term ‚Äúpackages‚Äù is common for src code in a monorepo.

+Write free text notes about life
+AI can answer questions about it mostly using RAG and large context window
+But it can also persist to triple store which it can later query
+Triple store can also be the backend for different apps. Like maybe I wanna know about my family tree, and so the ai generates a UI to visualize and edit that subset of the data

+Guy had heart attack on plane before take-off. He was ok but needed to deplane so delayed an hour
+Shuttled to hotel
+The resort front entrance is a path with shallow water on both sides. While admiring the ceiling Emily stepped right into the water üòÇ . The hotel didn‚Äôt have our room ready yet so Emily needed to sit through lunch with soaking shoes! We had lunch with Laura and Carolyn, who are Priya‚Äôs friends from camp. 
+Our room had a great view and jacuzzi!

+Dinner with Reiko, Cam, Olivia, and Kayla
